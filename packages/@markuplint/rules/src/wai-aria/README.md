# WAI-ARIA

Warn if the `role` attribute and/or `aria-*` attributes don't set in accordance with specs that are WAI-ARIA and/or "ARIA in HTML".

Warn if:

-   Use the role that doesn't exist in the spec.
-   Use the abstract role.
-   Use the `aria-*` attribute that doesn't belong to a set role (or an implicit role).
-   [Optional] Use a bad value of the `aria-*` attribute.
-   [Optional] Use the not permitted role according to ARIA in HTML.
-   [Optional] Set the implicit role explicitly.

There are settings about **ARIA in HTML** on [`@markuplint/html-spec`](https://github.com/markuplint/markuplint/tree/master/packages/%40markuplint/html-spec/src/aria-in-html). And you can disable them because that is draft yet.
