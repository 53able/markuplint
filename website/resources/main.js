Note: Browsers do not always display images. There are a number of situations in which a browser might not display images, such as: Non-visual browsers (such as those used by people with visual impairments) The user chooses not to display images (saving bandwidth, privacy reasons) The image is invalid or an unsupported type In these cases, the browser may replace the image with the text in the element\'s alt attribute. For these reasons and others, provide a useful value for alt whenever possible. Omitting alt altogether indicates that the image is a key part of the content and no textual equivalent is available. Setting this attribute to an empty string (alt=\\"\\") indicates that this image is not a key part of the content (it’s decoration or a tracking pixel), and that non-visual browsers may omit it from rendering. Visual browsers will also hide the broken image icon if the alt is empty and the image failed to display. This attribute is also used when copying and pasting the image to text, or saving a linked image to a bookmark. Indicates if the fetching of the image must be done using a CORS request. Image data from a CORS-enabled image returned from a CORS request can be reused in the <canvas> element without being marked \\"tainted\\". If the crossorigin attribute is not specified, then a non-CORS request is sent (without the Origin request header), and the browser marks the image as tainted and restricts access to its image data, preventing its usage in <canvas> elements. If the crossorigin attribute is specified, then a CORS request is sent (with the Origin request header); but if the server does not opt into allowing cross-origin access to the image data by the origin site (by not sending any Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header, or by not including the site\'s origin in any Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header it does send), then the browser marks the image as tainted and restricts access to its image data, preventing its usage in <canvas> elements. Allowed values: anonymous A CORS request is sent with credentials omitted (that is, no cookies, X.509 certificates, or Authorization request header). use-credentials The CORS request is sent with any credentials included (that is, cookies, X.509 certificates, and the Authorization request header). If the server does not opt into sharing credentials with the origin site (by sending back the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true response header), then the browser marks the image as tainted and restricts access to its image data. If the attribute has an invalid value, browsers handle it as if the anonymous value was used. See CORS settings attributes for additional information. Provides an image decoding hint to the browser. Allowed values: sync Decode the image synchronously, for atomic presentation with other content. async Decode the image asynchronously, to reduce delay in presenting other content. auto Default: no preference for the decoding mode. The browser decides what is best for the user. The intrinsic height of the image, in pixels. Must be an integer without a unit.Indicates the relative download importance of the resource. Priority hints allow the values: auto: no preference. The browser may use its own heuristics to prioritize the image. high: the image is of high priority. low: the image is of low priority. This attribute tells the browser to ignore the actual intrinsic size of the image and pretend it’s the size specified in the attribute. Specifically, the image would raster at these dimensions and naturalWidth/naturalHeight on images would return the values specified in this attribute. Explainer, examplesThis Boolean attribute indicates that the image is part of a server-side map. If so, the coordinates where the user clicked on the image are sent to the server.

The intent is to avoid the network and storage bandwidth needed to handle the image until it\'s reasonably certain that it will be needed. This generally improves the performance of the content in most typical use cases. Note: Loading is only deferred when JavaScript is enabled. This is an anti-tracking measure, because if a user agent supported lazy loading when scripting is disabled, it would still be possible for a site to track a user\'s approximate scroll position throughout a session, by strategically placing images in a page\'s markup such that a server can track how many images are requested and when.

See the file input type. Valid for the image button only, the alt attribute provides alternative text for the image, displaying the value of the attribute if the image src is missing or otherwise fails to load. See the image input type. (Not a Boolean attribute!) The autocomplete attribute takes as its value a space-separated string that describes what, if any, type of autocomplete functionality the input should provide. A typical implementation of autocomplete simply recalls previous values entered in the same input field, but more complex forms of autocomplete can exist. For instance, a browser could integrate with a device\'s contacts list to autocomplete email addresses in an email input field. See Values in The HTML autocomplete attribute for permitted values. The autocomplete attribute is valid on hidden, text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, range, color, and password. This attribute has no effect on input types that do not return numeric or text data, being valid for all input types except checkbox, radio, file, or any of the button types. See The HTML autocomplete attribute for additional information, including information on password security and how autocomplete is slightly different for hidden than for other input types. A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the input should automatically have focus when the page has finished loading (or when the <dialog> containing the element has been displayed). Note: An element with the autofocus attribute may gain focus before the DOMContentLoaded event is fired. No more than one element in the document may have the autofocus attribute. If put on more than one element, the first one with the attribute receives focus. The autofocus attribute cannot be used on inputs of type hidden, since hidden inputs cannot be focused. Warning: Automatically focusing a form control can confuse visually-impaired people using screen-reading technology and people with cognitive impairments. When autofocus is assigned, screen-readers \\"teleport\\" their user to the form control without warning them beforehand. Use careful consideration for accessibility when applying the autofocus attribute. Automatically focusing on a control can cause the page to scroll on load. The focus can also cause dynamic keyboards to display on some touch devices. While a screen reader will announce the label of the form control receiving focus, the screen reader will not announce anything before the label, and the sighted user on a small device will equally miss the context created by the preceding content. Introduced in the HTML Media Capture specification and valid for the file input type only, the capture attribute defines which media—microphone, video, or camera—should be used to capture a new file for upload with file upload control in supporting scenarios. See the file input type. Valid for both radio and checkbox types, checked is a Boolean attribute. If present on a radio type, it indicates that that radio button is the currently selected one in the group of same-named radio buttons. If present on a checkbox type, it indicates that the checkbox is checked by default (when the page loads). It does not indicate whether this checkbox is currently checked: if the checkbox’s state is changed, this content attribute does not reflect the change. (Only the HTMLInputElement’s checked IDL attribute is updated.) Note: Unlike other input controls, a checkboxes and radio buttons value are only included in the submitted data if they are currently checked. If they are, the name and the value(s) of the checked controls are submitted. For example, if a checkbox whose name is fruit has a value of cherry, and the checkbox is checked, the form data submitted will include fruit=cherry. If the checkbox isn\'t active, it isn\'t listed in the form data at all. The default value for checkboxes and radio buttons is on. Valid for text and search input types only, the dirname attribute enables the submission of the directionality of the element. When included, the form control will submit with two name/value pairs: the first being the name and value, the second being the value of the dirname as the name with the value of ltr or rtl being set by the browser. <form action=\\"page.html\\" method=\\"post\\"> <label>Fruit: <input type=\\"text\\" name=\\"fruit\\" dirname=\\"fruit.dir\\" value=\\"cherry\\"></label> <input type=\\"submit\\"/> </form> \x3c!-- page.html?fruit=cherry&fruit.dir=ltr --\x3e When the form above is submitted, the input cause both the name / value pair of fruit=cherry and the dirname / direction pair of fruit.dir=ltr to be sent. A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to interact with the input. Disabled inputs are typically rendered with a dimmer color or using some other form of indication that the field is not available for use. Specifically, disabled inputs do not receive the click event, and disabled inputs are not submitted with the form. Note: Although not required by the specification, Firefox will by default persist the dynamic disabled state of an <input> across page loads. Use the autocomplete attribute to control this feature. A string specifying the <form> element with which the input is associated (that is, its form owner). This string\'s value, if present, must match the id of a <form> element in the same document. If this attribute isn\'t specified, the <input> element is associated with the nearest containing form, if any. The form attribute lets you place an input anywhere in the document but have it included with a form elsewhere in the document. Note: An input can only be associated with one form.

Valid for the image input button only, the height is the height of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, it defines a unique identifier (ID) which must be unique in the whole document. Its purpose is to identify the element when linking. The value is used as the value of the <label>\'s for attribute to link the label with the form control. See <label>. Global value valid for all elements, it provides a hint to browsers as to the type of virtual keyboard configuration to use when editing this element or its contents. Values include none, text, tel, url, email, numeric, decimal, and search. The value given to the list attribute should be. the id of a <datalist> element located in the same document. The <datalist> provides a list of predefined values to suggest to the user for this input. Any values in the list that are not compatible with the type are not included in the suggested options. The values provided are suggestions, not requirements: users can select from this predefined list or provide a different value. <datalist id=\\"colorsxx\\"> <option>#ff0000</option> <option>#ee0000</option> <option>#dd0000</option> <option>#cc0000</option> <option>#bb0000</option> </datalist> <datalist id=\\"numbersxx\\"> <option>0</option> <option>2</option> <option>4</option> <option>8</option> <option>16</option> <option>32</option> <option>64</option> </datalist> <datalist id=\\"fruitsxx\\"> <option>cherry</option> <option>banana</option> <option>mango</option> <option>orange</option> <option>blueberry</option> </datalist> <datalist id=\\"urlsxx\\"> <option>https://developer.mozilla.org</option> <option>https://caniuse.com/</option> <option>https://mozilla.com</option> <option>https://mdn.github.io</option> <option>https://www.youtube.com/user/firefoxchannel</option> </datalist> <p><label for=\\"textx\\">Text</label> <input type=\\"text\\" list=\\"fruitsxx\\" id=\\"textx\\"/></p> <p><label for=\\"colorx\\">Color</label> <input type=\\"color\\" list=\\"colorsxx\\" id=\\"colorx\\"/></p> <p><label for=\\"rangex\\">Range</label> <input type=\\"range\\" min=\\"0\\" max=\\"64\\" list=\\"numbersxx\\" id=\\"rangex\\"/></p> <p><label for=\\"numberx\\">Number</label> <input type=\\"number\\" min=\\"0\\" max=\\"64\\" list=\\"numbersxx\\" id=\\"numberx\\"/></p> <p><label for=\\"urlx\\">URL</label> <input type=\\"url\\" list=\\"urlsxx\\" id=\\"urlx\\"/></p> It is valid on text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, range, and color. Per the specifications, the list attribute is not supported by the hidden, password, checkbox, radio, file, or any of the button types. Depending on the browser, the user may see a custom color palette suggested, tic marks along a range, or even a input that opens like a <select> but allows for non-listed values. Check out the browser compatibility table for the other input types. See the <datalist> element. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the greatest value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element exceeds this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the max attribute isn\'t a number, then the element has no maximum value. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the maximum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the field. This must be an integer value 0 or higher. If no maxlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the field has no maximum length. This value must also be greater than or equal to the value of minlength. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is greater than maxlength UTF-16 code units long. By default, browsers prevent users from entering more characters than allowed by the maxlength attribute. See Client-side validation for more information. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the most negative value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element is less than this this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the min attribute isn\'t a number, then the element has no minimum value. This value must be less than or equal to the value of the max attribute. If the min attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no min value is applied. If the min attribute is valid and a non-empty value is less than the minimum allowed by the min attribute, constraint validation will prevent form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the minimum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the entry field. This must be an non-negative integer value smaller than or equal to the value specified by maxlength. If no minlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the input has no minimum length. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is fewer than minlength UTF-16 code units long, preventing form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. The Boolean multiple attribute, if set, means the user can enter comma separated email addresses in the email widget or can choose more than one file with the file input. See the email and file input type. A string specifying a name for the input control. This name is submitted along with the control\'s value when the form data is submitted. What\'s in a name Consider the name a required attribute (even though it\'s not). If an input has no name specified, or name is empty, the input\'s value is not submitted with the form! (Disabled controls, unchecked radio buttons, unchecked checkboxes, and reset buttons are also not sent.) There are two special cases: _charset_ : If used as the name of an <input> element of type hidden, the input\'s value is automatically set by the user agent to the character encoding being used to submit the form. isindex: For historical reasons, the name isindex is not allowed. name and radio buttons The name attribute creates a unique behavior for radio buttons. Only one radio button in a same-named group of radio buttons can be checked at a time. Selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any currently-selected radio button in the same group. The value of that one checked radio button is sent along with the name if the form is submitted, When tabbing into a series of same-named group of radio buttons, if one is checked, that one will receive focus. If they aren\'t grouped together in source order, if one of the group is checked, tabbing into the group starts when the first one in the group is encountered, skipping all those that aren\'t checked. In other words, if one is checked, tabbing skips the unchecked radio buttons in the group. If none are checked, the radio button group receives focus when the first button in the same name group is reached. Once one of the radio buttons in a group has focus, using the arrow keys will navigate through all the radio buttons of the same name, even if the radio buttons are not grouped together in the source order. HTMLFormElement.elements When an input element is given a name, that name becomes a property of the owning form element\'s HTMLFormElement.elements property. If you have an input whose name is set to guest and another whose name is hat-size, the following code can be used: let form = document.querySelector(\\"form\\"); let guestName = form.elements.guest; let hatSize = form.elements[\\"hat-size\\"]; When this code has run, guestName will be the HTMLInputElement for the guest field, and hatSize the object for the hat-size field. Warning: Avoid giving form elements a name that corresponds to a built-in property of the form, since you would then override the predefined property or method with this reference to the corresponding input. The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the input\'s value must match in order for the value to pass constraint validation. It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the RegExp type, and as documented in our guide on regular expressions; the \'u\' flag is specified when compiling the regular expression, so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as ASCII. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text. If the pattern attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no regular expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely. If the pattern attribute is valid and a non-empty value does not match the pattern, constraint validation will prevent form submission. Tip: If using the pattern attribute, inform the user about the expected format by including explanatory text nearby. You can also include a title attribute to explain what the requirements are to match the pattern; most browsers will display this title as as a tooltip. The visible explanation is required for accessibility. The tooltip is an enhancement. See Client-side validation for more information. The placeholder attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that demonstrates the expected type of data, rather than an explanatory message. The text must not include carriage returns or line feeds. Note: The placeholder attribute is not as semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause unexpected technical issues with your content. See Labels in <input>: The Input (Form Input) element for more information. A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to edit the value of the input. The readonly attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and password input types. See the HTML attribute: readonly for more information. required is a Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user must specify a value for the input before the owning form can be submitted. The required attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, password, checkbox, radio, and file. See Client-side validation and the HTML attribute: required for more information. Valid for email, password, tel, and text input types only. Specifies how much of the input is shown. Basically creates same result as setting CSS width property with a few specialities. The actual unit of the value depends on the input type. For password and text it\'s number of characters (or em units) and pixels for others. CSS width takes precedence over size attribute. Valid for the image input button only, the src is string specifying the URL of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type. Valid for the numeric input types, including number, date/time input types, and range, the step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to. If not explicitly included, step defaults to 1 for number and range, and 1 unit type (second, week, month, day) for the date/time input types. The value can must be a positive number—integer or float—or the special value any, which means no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max). If any is not explicity set, valid values for the number, date/time input types, and range input types are equal to the basis for stepping - the min value and increments of the step value, up to the max value, if specified. For example, if you have <input type=\\"number\\" min=\\"10\\" step=\\"2\\">, then any even integer, 10 or greater, is valid. If omitted, <input type=\\"number\\">, any integer is valid, but floats (like 4.2) are not valid, because step defaults to 1. For 4.2 to be valid, step would have had to be set to any, 0.1, 0.2, or any the min value would have had to be a number ending in .2, such as <input type=\\"number\\" min=\\"-5.2\\"> Note: When the data entered by the user doesn\'t adhere to the stepping configuration, the value is considered invalid in contraint validation and will match the :invalid pseudoclass. The default stepping value for number inputs is 1, allowing only integers to be entered, unless the stepping base is not an integer. The default stepping value for time is 1 second (with 900 being equal to 15 minutes). See Client-side validation for more information. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, an integer attribute indicating if the element can take input focus (is focusable), if it should participate to sequential keyboard navigation. As all input types except for input of type hidden are focusable, this attribute should not be used on form controls, because doing so would require the management of the focus order for all elements within the document with the risk of harming usability and accessibility if done incorrectly. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all input types, containing a text representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to. Such information can typically, but not necessarily, be presented to the user as a tooltip. The title should NOT be used as the primary explanation of the purpose of the form control. Instead, use the <label> element with a for attribute set to the form control\'s id attribute. See Labels below. A string specifying the type of control to render. For example, to create a checkbox, a value of checkbox is used. If omitted (or an unknown value is specified), the input type text is used, creating a plaintext input field. Permitted values are listed in <input> types above. The input control\'s value. When specified in the HTML, this is the initial value, and from then on it can be altered or retrieved at any time using JavaScript to access the respective HTMLInputElement object\'s value property. The value attribute is always optional, though should be considered mandatory for checkbox, radio, and hidden. Valid for the image input button only, the width is the width of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type.","type":"AcceptList","condition":{"self":"[type=file]"}},{"name":"alt","description":"Valid for the image button only, the alt attribute provides alternative text for the image, displaying the value of the attribute if the image src is missing or otherwise fails to load. See the image input type. (Not a Boolean attribute!) The autocomplete attribute takes as its value a space-separated string that describes what, if any, type of autocomplete functionality the input should provide. A typical implementation of autocomplete simply recalls previous values entered in the same input field, but more complex forms of autocomplete can exist. For instance, a browser could integrate with a device\'s contacts list to autocomplete email addresses in an email input field. See Values in The HTML autocomplete attribute for permitted values. The autocomplete attribute is valid on hidden, text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, range, color, and password. This attribute has no effect on input types that do not return numeric or text data, being valid for all input types except checkbox, radio, file, or any of the button types. See The HTML autocomplete attribute for additional information, including information on password security and how autocomplete is slightly different for hidden than for other input types. A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the input should automatically have focus when the page has finished loading (or when the <dialog> containing the element has been displayed). Note: An element with the autofocus attribute may gain focus before the DOMContentLoaded event is fired. No more than one element in the document may have the autofocus attribute. If put on more than one element, the first one with the attribute receives focus. The autofocus attribute cannot be used on inputs of type hidden, since hidden inputs cannot be focused. Warning: Automatically focusing a form control can confuse visually-impaired people using screen-reading technology and people with cognitive impairments. When autofocus is assigned, screen-readers \\"teleport\\" their user to the form control without warning them beforehand. Use careful consideration for accessibility when applying the autofocus attribute. Automatically focusing on a control can cause the page to scroll on load. The focus can also cause dynamic keyboards to display on some touch devices. While a screen reader will announce the label of the form control receiving focus, the screen reader will not announce anything before the label, and the sighted user on a small device will equally miss the context created by the preceding content. Introduced in the HTML Media Capture specification and valid for the file input type only, the capture attribute defines which media—microphone, video, or camera—should be used to capture a new file for upload with file upload control in supporting scenarios. See the file input type. Valid for both radio and checkbox types, checked is a Boolean attribute. If present on a radio type, it indicates that that radio button is the currently selected one in the group of same-named radio buttons. If present on a checkbox type, it indicates that the checkbox is checked by default (when the page loads). It does not indicate whether this checkbox is currently checked: if the checkbox’s state is changed, this content attribute does not reflect the change. (Only the HTMLInputElement’s checked IDL attribute is updated.) Note: Unlike other input controls, a checkboxes and radio buttons value are only included in the submitted data if they are currently checked. If they are, the name and the value(s) of the checked controls are submitted. For example, if a checkbox whose name is fruit has a value of cherry, and the checkbox is checked, the form data submitted will include fruit=cherry. If the checkbox isn\'t active, it isn\'t listed in the form data at all. The default value for checkboxes and radio buttons is on. Valid for text and search input types only, the dirname attribute enables the submission of the directionality of the element. When included, the form control will submit with two name/value pairs: the first being the name and value, the second being the value of the dirname as the name with the value of ltr or rtl being set by the browser. <form action=\\"page.html\\" method=\\"post\\"> <label>Fruit: <input type=\\"text\\" name=\\"fruit\\" dirname=\\"fruit.dir\\" value=\\"cherry\\"></label> <input type=\\"submit\\"/> </form> \x3c!-- page.html?fruit=cherry&fruit.dir=ltr --\x3e When the form above is submitted, the input cause both the name / value pair of fruit=cherry and the dirname / direction pair of fruit.dir=ltr to be sent. A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to interact with the input. Disabled inputs are typically rendered with a dimmer color or using some other form of indication that the field is not available for use. Specifically, disabled inputs do not receive the click event, and disabled inputs are not submitted with the form. Note: Although not required by the specification, Firefox will by default persist the dynamic disabled state of an <input> across page loads. Use the autocomplete attribute to control this feature. A string specifying the <form> element with which the input is associated (that is, its form owner). This string\'s value, if present, must match the id of a <form> element in the same document. If this attribute isn\'t specified, the <input> element is associated with the nearest containing form, if any. The form attribute lets you place an input anywhere in the document but have it included with a form elsewhere in the document. Note: An input can only be associated with one form. Valid for the image and submit input types only. See the submit input type for more information. Valid for the image and submit input types only. See the submit input type for more information. Valid for the image and submit input types only. See the submit input type for more information. Valid for the image and submit input types only. See the submit input type for more information. Valid for the image and submit input types only. See the submit input type for more information. Valid for the image input button only, the height is the height of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, it defines a unique identifier (ID) which must be unique in the whole document. Its purpose is to identify the element when linking. The value is used as the value of the <label>\'s for attribute to link the label with the form control. See <label>. Global value valid for all elements, it provides a hint to browsers as to the type of virtual keyboard configuration to use when editing this element or its contents. Values include none, text, tel, url, email, numeric, decimal, and search. The value given to the list attribute should be. the id of a <datalist> element located in the same document. The <datalist> provides a list of predefined values to suggest to the user for this input. Any values in the list that are not compatible with the type are not included in the suggested options. The values provided are suggestions, not requirements: users can select from this predefined list or provide a different value. <datalist id=\\"colorsxx\\"> <option>#ff0000</option> <option>#ee0000</option> <option>#dd0000</option> <option>#cc0000</option> <option>#bb0000</option> </datalist> <datalist id=\\"numbersxx\\"> <option>0</option> <option>2</option> <option>4</option> <option>8</option> <option>16</option> <option>32</option> <option>64</option> </datalist> <datalist id=\\"fruitsxx\\"> <option>cherry</option> <option>banana</option> <option>mango</option> <option>orange</option> <option>blueberry</option> </datalist> <datalist id=\\"urlsxx\\"> <option>https://developer.mozilla.org</option> <option>https://caniuse.com/</option> <option>https://mozilla.com</option> <option>https://mdn.github.io</option> <option>https://www.youtube.com/user/firefoxchannel</option> </datalist> <p><label for=\\"textx\\">Text</label> <input type=\\"text\\" list=\\"fruitsxx\\" id=\\"textx\\"/></p> <p><label for=\\"colorx\\">Color</label> <input type=\\"color\\" list=\\"colorsxx\\" id=\\"colorx\\"/></p> <p><label for=\\"rangex\\">Range</label> <input type=\\"range\\" min=\\"0\\" max=\\"64\\" list=\\"numbersxx\\" id=\\"rangex\\"/></p> <p><label for=\\"numberx\\">Number</label> <input type=\\"number\\" min=\\"0\\" max=\\"64\\" list=\\"numbersxx\\" id=\\"numberx\\"/></p> <p><label for=\\"urlx\\">URL</label> <input type=\\"url\\" list=\\"urlsxx\\" id=\\"urlx\\"/></p> It is valid on text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, range, and color. Per the specifications, the list attribute is not supported by the hidden, password, checkbox, radio, file, or any of the button types. Depending on the browser, the user may see a custom color palette suggested, tic marks along a range, or even a input that opens like a <select> but allows for non-listed values. Check out the browser compatibility table for the other input types. See the <datalist> element. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the greatest value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element exceeds this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the max attribute isn\'t a number, then the element has no maximum value. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the maximum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the field. This must be an integer value 0 or higher. If no maxlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the field has no maximum length. This value must also be greater than or equal to the value of minlength. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is greater than maxlength UTF-16 code units long. By default, browsers prevent users from entering more characters than allowed by the maxlength attribute. See Client-side validation for more information. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the most negative value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element is less than this this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the min attribute isn\'t a number, then the element has no minimum value. This value must be less than or equal to the value of the max attribute. If the min attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no min value is applied. If the min attribute is valid and a non-empty value is less than the minimum allowed by the min attribute, constraint validation will prevent form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the minimum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the entry field. This must be an non-negative integer value smaller than or equal to the value specified by maxlength. If no minlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the input has no minimum length. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is fewer than minlength UTF-16 code units long, preventing form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. The Boolean multiple attribute, if set, means the user can enter comma separated email addresses in the email widget or can choose more than one file with the file input. See the email and file input type. A string specifying a name for the input control. This name is submitted along with the control\'s value when the form data is submitted. What\'s in a name Consider the name a required attribute (even though it\'s not). If an input has no name specified, or name is empty, the input\'s value is not submitted with the form! (Disabled controls, unchecked radio buttons, unchecked checkboxes, and reset buttons are also not sent.) There are two special cases: _charset_ : If used as the name of an <input> element of type hidden, the input\'s value is automatically set by the user agent to the character encoding being used to submit the form. isindex: For historical reasons, the name isindex is not allowed. name and radio buttons The name attribute creates a unique behavior for radio buttons. Only one radio button in a same-named group of radio buttons can be checked at a time. Selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any currently-selected radio button in the same group. The value of that one checked radio button is sent along with the name if the form is submitted, When tabbing into a series of same-named group of radio buttons, if one is checked, that one will receive focus. If they aren\'t grouped together in source order, if one of the group is checked, tabbing into the group starts when the first one in the group is encountered, skipping all those that aren\'t checked. In other words, if one is checked, tabbing skips the unchecked radio buttons in the group. If none are checked, the radio button group receives focus when the first button in the same name group is reached. Once one of the radio buttons in a group has focus, using the arrow keys will navigate through all the radio buttons of the same name, even if the radio buttons are not grouped together in the source order. HTMLFormElement.elements When an input element is given a name, that name becomes a property of the owning form element\'s HTMLFormElement.elements property. If you have an input whose name is set to guest and another whose name is hat-size, the following code can be used: let form = document.querySelector(\\"form\\"); let guestName = form.elements.guest; let hatSize = form.elements[\\"hat-size\\"]; When this code has run, guestName will be the HTMLInputElement for the guest field, and hatSize the object for the hat-size field. Warning: Avoid giving form elements a name that corresponds to a built-in property of the form, since you would then override the predefined property or method with this reference to the corresponding input. The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the input\'s value must match in order for the value to pass constraint validation. It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the RegExp type, and as documented in our guide on regular expressions; the \'u\' flag is specified when compiling the regular expression, so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as ASCII. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text. If the pattern attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no regular expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely. If the pattern attribute is valid and a non-empty value does not match the pattern, constraint validation will prevent form submission. Tip: If using the pattern attribute, inform the user about the expected format by including explanatory text nearby. You can also include a title attribute to explain what the requirements are to match the pattern; most browsers will display this title as as a tooltip. The visible explanation is required for accessibility. The tooltip is an enhancement. See Client-side validation for more information. The placeholder attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that demonstrates the expected type of data, rather than an explanatory message. The text must not include carriage returns or line feeds. Note: The placeholder attribute is not as semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause unexpected technical issues with your content. See Labels in <input>: The Input (Form Input) element for more information. A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to edit the value of the input. The readonly attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and password input types. See the HTML attribute: readonly for more information. required is a Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user must specify a value for the input before the owning form can be submitted. The required attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, password, checkbox, radio, and file. See Client-side validation and the HTML attribute: required for more information. Valid for email, password, tel, and text input types only. Specifies how much of the input is shown. Basically creates same result as setting CSS width property with a few specialities. The actual unit of the value depends on the input type. For password and text it\'s number of characters (or em units) and pixels for others. CSS width takes precedence over size attribute. Valid for the image input button only, the src is string specifying the URL of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type. Valid for the numeric input types, including number, date/time input types, and range, the step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to. If not explicitly included, step defaults to 1 for number and range, and 1 unit type (second, week, month, day) for the date/time input types. The value can must be a positive number—integer or float—or the special value any, which means no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max). If any is not explicity set, valid values for the number, date/time input types, and range input types are equal to the basis for stepping - the min value and increments of the step value, up to the max value, if specified. For example, if you have <input type=\\"number\\" min=\\"10\\" step=\\"2\\">, then any even integer, 10 or greater, is valid. If omitted, <input type=\\"number\\">, any integer is valid, but floats (like 4.2) are not valid, because step defaults to 1. For 4.2 to be valid, step would have had to be set to any, 0.1, 0.2, or any the min value would have had to be a number ending in .2, such as <input type=\\"number\\" min=\\"-5.2\\"> Note: When the data entered by the user doesn\'t adhere to the stepping configuration, the value is considered invalid in contraint validation and will match the :invalid pseudoclass. The default stepping value for number inputs is 1, allowing only integers to be entered, unless the stepping base is not an integer. The default stepping value for time is 1 second (with 900 being equal to 15 minutes). See Client-side validation for more information. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, an integer attribute indicating if the element can take input focus (is focusable), if it should participate to sequential keyboard navigation.

Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the maximum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the field. This must be an integer value 0 or higher. If no maxlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the field has no maximum length. This value must also be greater than or equal to the value of minlength.

This must be an non-negative integer value smaller than or equal to the value specified by maxlength. If no minlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the input has no minimum length. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is fewer than minlength UTF-16 code units long, preventing form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. The Boolean multiple attribute, if set, means the user can enter comma separated email addresses in the email widget or can choose more than one file with the file input. See the email and file input type. A string specifying a name for the input control. This name is submitted along with the control\'s value when the form data is submitted. What\'s in a name Consider the name a required attribute (even though it\'s not). If an input has no name specified, or name is empty, the input\'s value is not submitted with the form! (Disabled controls, unchecked radio buttons, unchecked checkboxes, and reset buttons are also not sent.) There are two special cases: _charset_ : If used as the name of an <input> element of type hidden, the input\'s value is automatically set by the user agent to the character encoding being used to submit the form. isindex: For historical reasons, the name isindex is not allowed. name and radio buttons The name attribute creates a unique behavior for radio buttons. Only one radio button in a same-named group of radio buttons can be checked at a time. Selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any currently-selected radio button in the same group. The value of that one checked radio button is sent along with the name if the form is submitted, When tabbing into a series of same-named group of radio buttons, if one is checked, that one will receive focus. If they aren\'t grouped together in source order, if one of the group is checked, tabbing into the group starts when the first one in the group is encountered, skipping all those that aren\'t checked. In other words, if one is checked, tabbing skips the unchecked radio buttons in the group. If none are checked, the radio button group receives focus when the first button in the same name group is reached. Once one of the radio buttons in a group has focus, using the arrow keys will navigate through all the radio buttons of the same name, even if the radio buttons are not grouped together in the source order. HTMLFormElement.elements When an input element is given a name, that name becomes a property of the owning form element\'s HTMLFormElement.elements property. If you have an input whose name is set to guest and another whose name is hat-size, the following code can be used: let form = document.querySelector(\\"form\\"); let guestName = form.elements.guest; let hatSize = form.elements[\\"hat-size\\"]; When this code has run, guestName will be the HTMLInputElement for the guest field, and hatSize the object for the hat-size field. Warning: Avoid giving form elements a name that corresponds to a built-in property of the form, since you would then override the predefined property or method with this reference to the corresponding input. The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the input\'s value must match in order for the value to pass constraint validation. It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the RegExp type, and as documented in our guide on regular expressions; the \'u\' flag is specified when compiling the regular expression, so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as ASCII. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text. If the pattern attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no regular expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely. If the pattern attribute is valid and a non-empty value does not match the pattern, constraint validation will prevent form submission. Tip: If using the pattern attribute, inform the user about the expected format by including explanatory text nearby. You can also include a title attribute to explain what the requirements are to match the pattern; most browsers will display this title as as a tooltip. The visible explanation is required for accessibility. The tooltip is an enhancement. See Client-side validation for more information. The placeholder attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that demonstrates the expected type of data, rather than an explanatory message. The text must not include carriage returns or line feeds. Note: The placeholder attribute is not as semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause unexpected technical issues with your content. See Labels in <input>: The Input (Form Input) element for more information. A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to edit the value of the input. The readonly attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and password input types. See the HTML attribute: readonly for more information. required is a Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user must specify a value for the input before the owning form can be submitted. The required attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, password, checkbox, radio, and file. See Client-side validation and the HTML attribute: required for more information. Valid for email, password, tel, and text input types only. Specifies how much of the input is shown. Basically creates same result as setting CSS width property with a few specialities. The actual unit of the value depends on the input type. For password and text it\'s number of characters (or em units) and pixels for others. CSS width takes precedence over size attribute. Valid for the image input button only, the src is string specifying the URL of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type. Valid for the numeric input types, including number, date/time input types, and range, the step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to. If not explicitly included, step defaults to 1 for number and range, and 1 unit type (second, week, month, day) for the date/time input types. The value can must be a positive number—integer or float—or the special value any, which means no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max). If any is not explicity set, valid values for the number, date/time input types, and range input types are equal to the basis for stepping - the min value and increments of the step value, up to the max value, if specified. For example, if you have <input type=\\"number\\" min=\\"10\\" step=\\"2\\">, then any even integer, 10 or greater, is valid. If omitted, <input type=\\"number\\">, any integer is valid, but floats (like 4.2) are not valid, because step defaults to 1. For 4.2 to be valid, step would have had to be set to any, 0.1, 0.2, or any the min value would have had to be a number ending in .2, such as <input type=\\"number\\" min=\\"-5.2\\"> Note: When the data entered by the user doesn\'t adhere to the stepping configuration, the value is considered invalid in contraint validation and will match the :invalid pseudoclass. The default stepping value for number inputs is 1, allowing only integers to be entered, unless the stepping base is not an integer. The default stepping value for time is 1 second (with 900 being equal to 15 minutes). See Client-side validation for more information. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, an integer attribute indicating if the element can take input focus (is focusable), if it should participate to sequential keyboard navigation. As all input types except for input of type hidden are focusable, this attribute should not be used on form controls, because doing so would require the management of the focus order for all elements within the document with the risk of harming usability and accessibility if done incorrectly. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all input types, containing a text representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to. Such information can typically, but not necessarily, be presented to the user as a tooltip. The title should NOT be used as the primary explanation of the purpose of the form control. Instead, use the <label> element with a for attribute set to the form control\'s id attribute. See Labels below. A string specifying the type of control to render. For example, to create a checkbox, a value of checkbox is used. If omitted (or an unknown value is specified), the input type text is used, creating a plaintext input field. Permitted values are listed in <input> types above. The input control\'s value. When specified in the HTML, this is the initial value, and from then on it can be altered or retrieved at any time using JavaScript to access the respective HTMLInputElement object\'s value property. The value attribute is always optional, though should be considered mandatory for checkbox, radio, and hidden.

The Boolean attribute incremental is a WebKit and Blink extension (so supported by Safari, Opera, Chrome, etc.) which, if present, tells the user agent to process the input as a live search. As the user edits the value of the field, the user agent sends search events to the HTMLInputElement object representing the search box. This allows your code to update the search results in real time as the user edits the search. If incremental is not specified, the search event is only sent when the user explicitly initiates a search (such as by pressing the Enter or Return key while editing the field). The search event is rate-limited so that it is not sent more more frequently than an implementation-defined interval.A Mozilla extension, supported by Firefox for Android, which provides a hint as to what sort of action will be taken if the user presses the Enter or Return key while editing the field. This information is used to decide what kind of label to use on the Enter key on the virtual keyboard. Note: This has been standardized as the global attribute enterkeyhint, but is not yet widely implemented. To see the status of the change being implemented in Firefox, see bug 1490661. Permitted values are: go, done, next, search, and send.

The value must be a non-negative decimal number. If not provided, or an invalid value is given, the browser\'s default maximum number of entries is used.The Boolean webkitdirectory attribute, if present, indicates that only directories should be available to be selected by the user in the file picker interface. See HTMLInputElement.webkitdirectory for additional details and examples.

Note: An element with the autofocus attribute may gain focus before the DOMContentLoaded event is fired. No more than one element in the document may have the autofocus attribute. If put on more than one element, the first one with the attribute receives focus. The autofocus attribute cannot be used on inputs of type hidden, since hidden inputs cannot be focused. Warning: Automatically focusing a form control can confuse visually-impaired people using screen-reading technology and people with cognitive impairments. When autofocus is assigned, screen-readers \\"teleport\\" their user to the form control without warning them beforehand. Use careful consideration for accessibility when applying the autofocus attribute. Automatically focusing on a control can cause the page to scroll on load. The focus can also cause dynamic keyboards to display on some touch devices. While a screen reader will announce the label of the form control receiving focus, the screen reader will not announce anything before the label, and the sighted user on a small device will equally miss the context created by the preceding content. Introduced in the HTML Media Capture specification and valid for the file input type only, the capture attribute defines which media—microphone, video, or camera—should be used to capture a new file for upload with file upload control in supporting scenarios. See the file input type. Valid for both radio and checkbox types, checked is a Boolean attribute. If present on a radio type, it indicates that that radio button is the currently selected one in the group of same-named radio buttons. If present on a checkbox type, it indicates that the checkbox is checked by default (when the page loads). It does not indicate whether this checkbox is currently checked: if the checkbox’s state is changed, this content attribute does not reflect the change. (Only the HTMLInputElement’s checked IDL attribute is updated.) Note: Unlike other input controls, a checkboxes and radio buttons value are only included in the submitted data if they are currently checked. If they are, the name and the value(s) of the checked controls are submitted. For example, if a checkbox whose name is fruit has a value of cherry, and the checkbox is checked, the form data submitted will include fruit=cherry. If the checkbox isn\'t active, it isn\'t listed in the form data at all. The default value for checkboxes and radio buttons is on. Valid for text and search input types only, the dirname attribute enables the submission of the directionality of the element. When included, the form control will submit with two name/value pairs: the first being the name and value, the second being the value of the dirname as the name with the value of ltr or rtl being set by the browser. <form action=\\"page.html\\" method=\\"post\\"> <label>Fruit: <input type=\\"text\\" name=\\"fruit\\" dirname=\\"fruit.dir\\" value=\\"cherry\\"></label> <input type=\\"submit\\"/> </form> \x3c!-- page.html?fruit=cherry&fruit.dir=ltr --\x3e When the form above is submitted, the input cause both the name / value pair of fruit=cherry and the dirname / direction pair of fruit.dir=ltr to be sent. A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to interact with the input. Disabled inputs are typically rendered with a dimmer color or using some other form of indication that the field is not available for use. Specifically, disabled inputs do not receive the click event, and disabled inputs are not submitted with the form. Note: Although not required by the specification, Firefox will by default persist the dynamic disabled state of an <input> across page loads. Use the autocomplete attribute to control this feature. A string specifying the <form> element with which the input is associated (that is, its form owner). This string\'s value, if present, must match the id of a <form> element in the same document. If this attribute isn\'t specified, the <input> element is associated with the nearest containing form, if any. The form attribute lets you place an input anywhere in the document but have it included with a form elsewhere in the document. Note: An input can only be associated with one form.

Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, it defines a unique identifier (ID) which must be unique in the whole document. Its purpose is to identify the element when linking. The value is used as the value of the <label>\'s for attribute to link the label with the form control. See <label>. Global value valid for all elements, it provides a hint to browsers as to the type of virtual keyboard configuration to use when editing this element or its contents. Values include none, text, tel, url, email, numeric, decimal, and search. The value given to the list attribute should be. the id of a <datalist> element located in the same document.

Check out the browser compatibility table for the other input types. See the <datalist> element. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the greatest value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element exceeds this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the max attribute isn\'t a number, then the element has no maximum value. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the maximum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the field. This must be an integer value 0 or higher. If no maxlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the field has no maximum length. This value must also be greater than or equal to the value of minlength. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is greater than maxlength UTF-16 code units long. By default, browsers prevent users from entering more characters than allowed by the maxlength attribute. See Client-side validation for more information. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the most negative value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element is less than this this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the min attribute isn\'t a number, then the element has no minimum value. This value must be less than or equal to the value of the max attribute. If the min attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no min value is applied. If the min attribute is valid and a non-empty value is less than the minimum allowed by the min attribute, constraint validation will prevent form submission.

A string specifying the <form> element with which the input is associated (that is, its form owner). This string\'s value, if present, must match the id of a <form> element in the same document. If this attribute isn\'t specified, the <input> element is associated with the nearest containing form, if any. The form attribute lets you place an input anywhere in the document but have it included with a form elsewhere in the document. Note: An input can only be associated with one form. Valid for the image and submit input types only. See the submit input type for more information. Valid for the image and submit input types only. See the submit input type for more information.

Valid for the image and submit input types only. See the submit input type for more information. Valid for the image input button only, the height is the height of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, it defines a unique identifier (ID) which must be unique in the whole document. Its purpose is to identify the element when linking. The value is used as the value of the <label>\'s for attribute to link the label with the form control. See <label>. Global value valid for all elements, it provides a hint to browsers as to the type of virtual keyboard configuration to use when editing this element or its contents. Values include none, text, tel, url, email, numeric, decimal, and search. The value given to the list attribute should be. the id of a <datalist> element located in the same document. The <datalist> provides a list of predefined values to suggest to the user for this input. Any values in the list that are not compatible with the type are not included in the suggested options. The values provided are suggestions, not requirements: users can select from this predefined list or provide a different value. <datalist id=\\"colorsxx\\"> <option>#ff0000</option> <option>#ee0000</option> <option>#dd0000</option> <option>#cc0000</option> <option>#bb0000</option> </datalist> <datalist id=\\"numbersxx\\"> <option>0</option> <option>2</option> <option>4</option> <option>8</option> <option>16</option> <option>32</option> <option>64</option> </datalist> <datalist id=\\"fruitsxx\\"> <option>cherry</option> <option>banana</option> <option>mango</option> <option>orange</option> <option>blueberry</option> </datalist> <datalist id=\\"urlsxx\\"> <option>https://developer.mozilla.org</option> <option>https://caniuse.com/</option> <option>https://mozilla.com</option> <option>https://mdn.github.io</option> <option>https://www.youtube.com/user/firefoxchannel</option> </datalist> <p><label for=\\"textx\\">Text</label> <input type=\\"text\\" list=\\"fruitsxx\\" id=\\"textx\\"/></p> <p><label for=\\"colorx\\">Color</label> <input type=\\"color\\" list=\\"colorsxx\\" id=\\"colorx\\"/></p> <p><label for=\\"rangex\\">Range</label> <input type=\\"range\\" min=\\"0\\" max=\\"64\\" list=\\"numbersxx\\" id=\\"rangex\\"/></p> <p><label for=\\"numberx\\">Number</label> <input type=\\"number\\" min=\\"0\\" max=\\"64\\" list=\\"numbersxx\\" id=\\"numberx\\"/></p> <p><label for=\\"urlx\\">URL</label> <input type=\\"url\\" list=\\"urlsxx\\" id=\\"urlx\\"/></p> It is valid on text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, range, and color. Per the specifications, the list attribute is not supported by the hidden, password, checkbox, radio, file, or any of the button types. Depending on the browser, the user may see a custom color palette suggested, tic marks along a range, or even a input that opens like a <select> but allows for non-listed values. Check out the browser compatibility table for the other input types. See the <datalist> element. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the greatest value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element exceeds this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the max attribute isn\'t a number, then the element has no maximum value. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the maximum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the field. This must be an integer value 0 or higher. If no maxlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the field has no maximum length. This value must also be greater than or equal to the value of minlength. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is greater than maxlength UTF-16 code units long. By default, browsers prevent users from entering more characters than allowed by the maxlength attribute. See Client-side validation for more information. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the most negative value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element is less than this this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the min attribute isn\'t a number, then the element has no minimum value. This value must be less than or equal to the value of the max attribute. If the min attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no min value is applied. If the min attribute is valid and a non-empty value is less than the minimum allowed by the min attribute, constraint validation will prevent form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the minimum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the entry field. This must be an non-negative integer value smaller than or equal to the value specified by maxlength. If no minlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the input has no minimum length. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is fewer than minlength UTF-16 code units long, preventing form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. The Boolean multiple attribute, if set, means the user can enter comma separated email addresses in the email widget or can choose more than one file with the file input. See the email and file input type. A string specifying a name for the input control. This name is submitted along with the control\'s value when the form data is submitted. What\'s in a name Consider the name a required attribute (even though it\'s not). If an input has no name specified, or name is empty, the input\'s value is not submitted with the form! (Disabled controls, unchecked radio buttons, unchecked checkboxes, and reset buttons are also not sent.) There are two special cases: _charset_ : If used as the name of an <input> element of type hidden, the input\'s value is automatically set by the user agent to the character encoding being used to submit the form. isindex: For historical reasons, the name isindex is not allowed. name and radio buttons The name attribute creates a unique behavior for radio buttons. Only one radio button in a same-named group of radio buttons can be checked at a time. Selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any currently-selected radio button in the same group. The value of that one checked radio button is sent along with the name if the form is submitted, When tabbing into a series of same-named group of radio buttons, if one is checked, that one will receive focus. If they aren\'t grouped together in source order, if one of the group is checked, tabbing into the group starts when the first one in the group is encountered, skipping all those that aren\'t checked. In other words, if one is checked, tabbing skips the unchecked radio buttons in the group. If none are checked, the radio button group receives focus when the first button in the same name group is reached. Once one of the radio buttons in a group has focus, using the arrow keys will navigate through all the radio buttons of the same name, even if the radio buttons are not grouped together in the source order. HTMLFormElement.elements When an input element is given a name, that name becomes a property of the owning form element\'s HTMLFormElement.elements property. If you have an input whose name is set to guest and another whose name is hat-size, the following code can be used: let form = document.querySelector(\\"form\\"); let guestName = form.elements.guest; let hatSize = form.elements[\\"hat-size\\"]; When this code has run, guestName will be the HTMLInputElement for the guest field, and hatSize the object for the hat-size field. Warning: Avoid giving form elements a name that corresponds to a built-in property of the form, since you would then override the predefined property or method with this reference to the corresponding input. The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the input\'s value must match in order for the value to pass constraint validation. It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the RegExp type, and as documented in our guide on regular expressions; the \'u\' flag is specified when compiling the regular expression, so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as ASCII. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text. If the pattern attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no regular expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely. If the pattern attribute is valid and a non-empty value does not match the pattern, constraint validation will prevent form submission. Tip: If using the pattern attribute, inform the user about the expected format by including explanatory text nearby. You can also include a title attribute to explain what the requirements are to match the pattern; most browsers will display this title as as a tooltip. The visible explanation is required for accessibility. The tooltip is an enhancement. See Client-side validation for more information. The placeholder attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that demonstrates the expected type of data, rather than an explanatory message. The text must not include carriage returns or line feeds. Note: The placeholder attribute is not as semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause unexpected technical issues with your content. See Labels in <input>: The Input (Form Input) element for more information. A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to edit the value of the input. The readonly attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and password input types. See the HTML attribute: readonly for more information. required is a Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user must specify a value for the input before the owning form can be submitted. The required attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, password, checkbox, radio, and file. See Client-side validation and the HTML attribute: required for more information. Valid for email, password, tel, and text input types only. Specifies how much of the input is shown. Basically creates same result as setting CSS width property with a few specialities. The actual unit of the value depends on the input type. For password and text it\'s number of characters (or em units) and pixels for others. CSS width takes precedence over size attribute. Valid for the image input button only, the src is string specifying the URL of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type. Valid for the numeric input types, including number, date/time input types, and range, the step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to. If not explicitly included, step defaults to 1 for number and range, and 1 unit type (second, week, month, day) for the date/time input types. The value can must be a positive number—integer or float—or the special value any, which means no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max). If any is not explicity set, valid values for the number, date/time input types, and range input types are equal to the basis for stepping - the min value and increments of the step value, up to the max value, if specified. For example, if you have <input type=\\"number\\" min=\\"10\\" step=\\"2\\">, then any even integer, 10 or greater, is valid. If omitted, <input type=\\"number\\">, any integer is valid, but floats (like 4.2) are not valid, because step defaults to 1. For 4.2 to be valid, step would have had to be set to any, 0.1, 0.2, or any the min value would have had to be a number ending in .2, such as <input type=\\"number\\" min=\\"-5.2\\"> Note: When the data entered by the user doesn\'t adhere to the stepping configuration, the value is considered invalid in contraint validation and will match the :invalid pseudoclass. The default stepping value for number inputs is 1, allowing only integers to be entered, unless the stepping base is not an integer. The default stepping value for time is 1 second (with 900 being equal to 15 minutes). See Client-side validation for more information. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, an integer attribute indicating if the element can take input focus (is focusable), if it should participate to sequential keyboard navigation. As all input types except for input of type hidden are focusable, this attribute should not be used on form controls, because doing so would require the management of the focus order for all elements within the document with the risk of harming usability and accessibility if done incorrectly. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all input types, containing a text representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to. Such information can typically, but not necessarily, be presented to the user as a tooltip. The title should NOT be used as the primary explanation of the purpose of the form control. Instead, use the <label> element with a for attribute set to the form control\'s id attribute. See Labels below. A string specifying the type of control to render. For example, to create a checkbox, a value of checkbox is used. If omitted (or an unknown value is specified), the input type text is used, creating a plaintext input field. Permitted values are listed in <input> types above. The input control\'s value. When specified in the HTML, this is the initial value, and from then on it can be altered or retrieved at any time using JavaScript to access the respective HTMLInputElement object\'s value property. The value attribute is always optional, though should be considered mandatory for checkbox, radio, and hidden. Valid for the image input button only, the width is the width of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type."},{"name":"checked","description":"Valid for both radio and checkbox types, checked is a Boolean attribute. If present on a radio type, it indicates that that radio button is the currently selected one in the group of same-named radio buttons. If present on a checkbox type, it indicates that the checkbox is checked by default (when the page loads). It does not indicate whether this checkbox is currently checked: if the checkbox’s state is changed, this content attribute does not reflect the change. (Only the HTMLInputElement’s checked IDL attribute is updated.) Note: Unlike other input controls, a checkboxes and radio buttons value are only included in the submitted data if they are currently checked. If they are, the name and the value(s) of the checked controls are submitted. For example, if a checkbox whose name is fruit has a value of cherry, and the checkbox is checked, the form data submitted will include fruit=cherry. If the checkbox isn\'t active, it isn\'t listed in the form data at all. The default value for checkboxes and radio buttons is on. Valid for text and search input types only, the dirname attribute enables the submission of the directionality of the element. When included, the form control will submit with two name/value pairs: the first being the name and value, the second being the value of the dirname as the name with the value of ltr or rtl being set by the browser. <form action=\\"page.html\\" method=\\"post\\"> <label>Fruit: <input type=\\"text\\" name=\\"fruit\\" dirname=\\"fruit.dir\\" value=\\"cherry\\"></label> <input type=\\"submit\\"/> </form> \x3c!-- page.html?fruit=cherry&fruit.dir=ltr --\x3e When the form above is submitted, the input cause both the name / value pair of fruit=cherry and the dirname / direction pair of fruit.dir=ltr to be sent. A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to interact with the input. Disabled inputs are typically rendered with a dimmer color or using some other form of indication that the field is not available for use. Specifically, disabled inputs do not receive the click event, and disabled inputs are not submitted with the form.

Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, it defines a unique identifier (ID) which must be unique in the whole document. Its purpose is to identify the element when linking. The value is used as the value of the <label>\'s for attribute to link the label with the form control. See <label>. Global value valid for all elements, it provides a hint to browsers as to the type of virtual keyboard configuration to use when editing this element or its contents. Values include none, text, tel, url, email, numeric, decimal, and search. The value given to the list attribute should be. the id of a <datalist> element located in the same document.

Per the specifications, the list attribute is not supported by the hidden, password, checkbox, radio, file, or any of the button types. Depending on the browser, the user may see a custom color palette suggested, tic marks along a range, or even a input that opens like a <select> but allows for non-listed values. Check out the browser compatibility table for the other input types. See the <datalist> element. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the greatest value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element exceeds this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the max attribute isn\'t a number, then the element has no maximum value. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the maximum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the field. This must be an integer value 0 or higher. If no maxlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the field has no maximum length. This value must also be greater than or equal to the value of minlength. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is greater than maxlength UTF-16 code units long. By default, browsers prevent users from entering more characters than allowed by the maxlength attribute. See Client-side validation for more information. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the most negative value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element is less than this this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the min attribute isn\'t a number, then the element has no minimum value. This value must be less than or equal to the value of the max attribute. If the min attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no min value is applied. If the min attribute is valid and a non-empty value is less than the minimum allowed by the min attribute, constraint validation will prevent form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the minimum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the entry field. This must be an non-negative integer value smaller than or equal to the value specified by maxlength. If no minlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the input has no minimum length. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is fewer than minlength UTF-16 code units long, preventing form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. The Boolean multiple attribute, if set, means the user can enter comma separated email addresses in the email widget or can choose more than one file with the file input. See the email and file input type. A string specifying a name for the input control. This name is submitted along with the control\'s value when the form data is submitted. What\'s in a name Consider the name a required attribute (even though it\'s not). If an input has no name specified, or name is empty, the input\'s value is not submitted with the form! (Disabled controls, unchecked radio buttons, unchecked checkboxes, and reset buttons are also not sent.) There are two special cases: _charset_ : If used as the name of an <input> element of type hidden, the input\'s value is automatically set by the user agent to the character encoding being used to submit the form. isindex: For historical reasons, the name isindex is not allowed. name and radio buttons The name attribute creates a unique behavior for radio buttons. Only one radio button in a same-named group of radio buttons can be checked at a time. Selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any currently-selected radio button in the same group. The value of that one checked radio button is sent along with the name if the form is submitted, When tabbing into a series of same-named group of radio buttons, if one is checked, that one will receive focus. If they aren\'t grouped together in source order, if one of the group is checked, tabbing into the group starts when the first one in the group is encountered, skipping all those that aren\'t checked. In other words, if one is checked, tabbing skips the unchecked radio buttons in the group. If none are checked, the radio button group receives focus when the first button in the same name group is reached. Once one of the radio buttons in a group has focus, using the arrow keys will navigate through all the radio buttons of the same name, even if the radio buttons are not grouped together in the source order. HTMLFormElement.elements When an input element is given a name, that name becomes a property of the owning form element\'s HTMLFormElement.elements property. If you have an input whose name is set to guest and another whose name is hat-size, the following code can be used: let form = document.querySelector(\\"form\\"); let guestName = form.elements.guest; let hatSize = form.elements[\\"hat-size\\"]; When this code has run, guestName will be the HTMLInputElement for the guest field, and hatSize the object for the hat-size field. Warning: Avoid giving form elements a name that corresponds to a built-in property of the form, since you would then override the predefined property or method with this reference to the corresponding input. The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the input\'s value must match in order for the value to pass constraint validation. It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the RegExp type, and as documented in our guide on regular expressions; the \'u\' flag is specified when compiling the regular expression, so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as ASCII. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text. If the pattern attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no regular expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely. If the pattern attribute is valid and a non-empty value does not match the pattern, constraint validation will prevent form submission. Tip: If using the pattern attribute, inform the user about the expected format by including explanatory text nearby. You can also include a title attribute to explain what the requirements are to match the pattern; most browsers will display this title as as a tooltip. The visible explanation is required for accessibility. The tooltip is an enhancement. See Client-side validation for more information. The placeholder attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that demonstrates the expected type of data, rather than an explanatory message. The text must not include carriage returns or line feeds. Note: The placeholder attribute is not as semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause unexpected technical issues with your content. See Labels in <input>: The Input (Form Input) element for more information. A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to edit the value of the input. The readonly attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and password input types. See the HTML attribute: readonly for more information. required is a Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user must specify a value for the input before the owning form can be submitted. The required attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, password, checkbox, radio, and file. See Client-side validation and the HTML attribute: required for more information. Valid for email, password, tel, and text input types only. Specifies how much of the input is shown. Basically creates same result as setting CSS width property with a few specialities. The actual unit of the value depends on the input type. For password and text it\'s number of characters (or em units) and pixels for others. CSS width takes precedence over size attribute. Valid for the image input button only, the src is string specifying the URL of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type. Valid for the numeric input types, including number, date/time input types, and range, the step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to. If not explicitly included, step defaults to 1 for number and range, and 1 unit type (second, week, month, day) for the date/time input types. The value can must be a positive number—integer or float—or the special value any, which means no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max). If any is not explicity set, valid values for the number, date/time input types, and range input types are equal to the basis for stepping - the min value and increments of the step value, up to the max value, if specified. For example, if you have <input type=\\"number\\" min=\\"10\\" step=\\"2\\">, then any even integer, 10 or greater, is valid. If omitted, <input type=\\"number\\">, any integer is valid, but floats (like 4.2) are not valid, because step defaults to 1. For 4.2 to be valid, step would have had to be set to any, 0.1, 0.2, or any the min value would have had to be a number ending in .2, such as <input type=\\"number\\" min=\\"-5.2\\"> Note: When the data entered by the user doesn\'t adhere to the stepping configuration, the value is considered invalid in contraint validation and will match the :invalid pseudoclass. The default stepping value for number inputs is 1, allowing only integers to be entered, unless the stepping base is not an integer. The default stepping value for time is 1 second (with 900 being equal to 15 minutes). See Client-side validation for more information. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, an integer attribute indicating if the element can take input focus (is focusable), if it should participate to sequential keyboard navigation. As all input types except for input of type hidden are focusable, this attribute should not be used on form controls, because doing so would require the management of the focus order for all elements within the document with the risk of harming usability and accessibility if done incorrectly. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all input types, containing a text representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to. Such information can typically, but not necessarily, be presented to the user as a tooltip. The title should NOT be used as the primary explanation of the purpose of the form control. Instead, use the <label> element with a for attribute set to the form control\'s id attribute. See Labels below. A string specifying the type of control to render. For example, to create a checkbox, a value of checkbox is used. If omitted (or an unknown value is specified), the input type text is used, creating a plaintext input field. Permitted values are listed in <input> types above. The input control\'s value. When specified in the HTML, this is the initial value, and from then on it can be altered or retrieved at any time using JavaScript to access the respective HTMLInputElement object\'s value property.

The form attribute lets you place an input anywhere in the document but have it included with a form elsewhere in the document. Note: An input can only be associated with one form. Valid for the image and submit input types only. See the submit input type for more information. Valid for the image and submit input types only. See the submit input type for more information.

Valid for the image input button only, the height is the height of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, it defines a unique identifier (ID) which must be unique in the whole document. Its purpose is to identify the element when linking. The value is used as the value of the <label>\'s for attribute to link the label with the form control. See <label>. Global value valid for all elements, it provides a hint to browsers as to the type of virtual keyboard configuration to use when editing this element or its contents. Values include none, text, tel, url, email, numeric, decimal, and search. The value given to the list attribute should be. the id of a <datalist> element located in the same document. The <datalist> provides a list of predefined values to suggest to the user for this input. Any values in the list that are not compatible with the type are not included in the suggested options. The values provided are suggestions, not requirements: users can select from this predefined list or provide a different value. <datalist id=\\"colorsxx\\"> <option>#ff0000</option> <option>#ee0000</option> <option>#dd0000</option> <option>#cc0000</option> <option>#bb0000</option> </datalist> <datalist id=\\"numbersxx\\"> <option>0</option> <option>2</option> <option>4</option> <option>8</option> <option>16</option> <option>32</option> <option>64</option> </datalist> <datalist id=\\"fruitsxx\\"> <option>cherry</option> <option>banana</option> <option>mango</option> <option>orange</option> <option>blueberry</option> </datalist> <datalist id=\\"urlsxx\\"> <option>https://developer.mozilla.org</option> <option>https://caniuse.com/</option> <option>https://mozilla.com</option> <option>https://mdn.github.io</option> <option>https://www.youtube.com/user/firefoxchannel</option> </datalist> <p><label for=\\"textx\\">Text</label> <input type=\\"text\\" list=\\"fruitsxx\\" id=\\"textx\\"/></p> <p><label for=\\"colorx\\">Color</label> <input type=\\"color\\" list=\\"colorsxx\\" id=\\"colorx\\"/></p> <p><label for=\\"rangex\\">Range</label> <input type=\\"range\\" min=\\"0\\" max=\\"64\\" list=\\"numbersxx\\" id=\\"rangex\\"/></p> <p><label for=\\"numberx\\">Number</label> <input type=\\"number\\" min=\\"0\\" max=\\"64\\" list=\\"numbersxx\\" id=\\"numberx\\"/></p> <p><label for=\\"urlx\\">URL</label> <input type=\\"url\\" list=\\"urlsxx\\" id=\\"urlx\\"/></p> It is valid on text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, range, and color. Per the specifications, the list attribute is not supported by the hidden, password, checkbox, radio, file, or any of the button types. Depending on the browser, the user may see a custom color palette suggested, tic marks along a range, or even a input that opens like a <select> but allows for non-listed values. Check out the browser compatibility table for the other input types. See the <datalist> element. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the greatest value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element exceeds this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the max attribute isn\'t a number, then the element has no maximum value. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the maximum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the field. This must be an integer value 0 or higher. If no maxlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the field has no maximum length. This value must also be greater than or equal to the value of minlength. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is greater than maxlength UTF-16 code units long. By default, browsers prevent users from entering more characters than allowed by the maxlength attribute. See Client-side validation for more information. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the most negative value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element is less than this this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the min attribute isn\'t a number, then the element has no minimum value. This value must be less than or equal to the value of the max attribute. If the min attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no min value is applied. If the min attribute is valid and a non-empty value is less than the minimum allowed by the min attribute, constraint validation will prevent form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the minimum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the entry field. This must be an non-negative integer value smaller than or equal to the value specified by maxlength. If no minlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the input has no minimum length. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is fewer than minlength UTF-16 code units long, preventing form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. The Boolean multiple attribute, if set, means the user can enter comma separated email addresses in the email widget or can choose more than one file with the file input. See the email and file input type. A string specifying a name for the input control. This name is submitted along with the control\'s value when the form data is submitted. What\'s in a name Consider the name a required attribute (even though it\'s not). If an input has no name specified, or name is empty, the input\'s value is not submitted with the form! (Disabled controls, unchecked radio buttons, unchecked checkboxes, and reset buttons are also not sent.) There are two special cases: _charset_ : If used as the name of an <input> element of type hidden, the input\'s value is automatically set by the user agent to the character encoding being used to submit the form. isindex: For historical reasons, the name isindex is not allowed. name and radio buttons The name attribute creates a unique behavior for radio buttons. Only one radio button in a same-named group of radio buttons can be checked at a time. Selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any currently-selected radio button in the same group. The value of that one checked radio button is sent along with the name if the form is submitted, When tabbing into a series of same-named group of radio buttons, if one is checked, that one will receive focus. If they aren\'t grouped together in source order, if one of the group is checked, tabbing into the group starts when the first one in the group is encountered, skipping all those that aren\'t checked. In other words, if one is checked, tabbing skips the unchecked radio buttons in the group. If none are checked, the radio button group receives focus when the first button in the same name group is reached. Once one of the radio buttons in a group has focus, using the arrow keys will navigate through all the radio buttons of the same name, even if the radio buttons are not grouped together in the source order. HTMLFormElement.elements When an input element is given a name, that name becomes a property of the owning form element\'s HTMLFormElement.elements property. If you have an input whose name is set to guest and another whose name is hat-size, the following code can be used: let form = document.querySelector(\\"form\\"); let guestName = form.elements.guest; let hatSize = form.elements[\\"hat-size\\"]; When this code has run, guestName will be the HTMLInputElement for the guest field, and hatSize the object for the hat-size field. Warning: Avoid giving form elements a name that corresponds to a built-in property of the form, since you would then override the predefined property or method with this reference to the corresponding input. The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the input\'s value must match in order for the value to pass constraint validation. It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the RegExp type, and as documented in our guide on regular expressions; the \'u\' flag is specified when compiling the regular expression, so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as ASCII. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text. If the pattern attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no regular expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely. If the pattern attribute is valid and a non-empty value does not match the pattern, constraint validation will prevent form submission. Tip: If using the pattern attribute, inform the user about the expected format by including explanatory text nearby. You can also include a title attribute to explain what the requirements are to match the pattern; most browsers will display this title as as a tooltip. The visible explanation is required for accessibility. The tooltip is an enhancement. See Client-side validation for more information. The placeholder attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that demonstrates the expected type of data, rather than an explanatory message. The text must not include carriage returns or line feeds. Note: The placeholder attribute is not as semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause unexpected technical issues with your content. See Labels in <input>: The Input (Form Input) element for more information. A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to edit the value of the input. The readonly attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and password input types. See the HTML attribute: readonly for more information. required is a Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user must specify a value for the input before the owning form can be submitted. The required attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, password, checkbox, radio, and file. See Client-side validation and the HTML attribute: required for more information. Valid for email, password, tel, and text input types only. Specifies how much of the input is shown. Basically creates same result as setting CSS width property with a few specialities. The actual unit of the value depends on the input type. For password and text it\'s number of characters (or em units) and pixels for others. CSS width takes precedence over size attribute. Valid for the image input button only, the src is string specifying the URL of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type. Valid for the numeric input types, including number, date/time input types, and range, the step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to. If not explicitly included, step defaults to 1 for number and range, and 1 unit type (second, week, month, day) for the date/time input types. The value can must be a positive number—integer or float—or the special value any, which means no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max). If any is not explicity set, valid values for the number, date/time input types, and range input types are equal to the basis for stepping - the min value and increments of the step value, up to the max value, if specified. For example, if you have <input type=\\"number\\" min=\\"10\\" step=\\"2\\">, then any even integer, 10 or greater, is valid. If omitted, <input type=\\"number\\">, any integer is valid, but floats (like 4.2) are not valid, because step defaults to 1. For 4.2 to be valid, step would have had to be set to any, 0.1, 0.2, or any the min value would have had to be a number ending in .2, such as <input type=\\"number\\" min=\\"-5.2\\"> Note: When the data entered by the user doesn\'t adhere to the stepping configuration, the value is considered invalid in contraint validation and will match the :invalid pseudoclass. The default stepping value for number inputs is 1, allowing only integers to be entered, unless the stepping base is not an integer. The default stepping value for time is 1 second (with 900 being equal to 15 minutes). See Client-side validation for more information. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, an integer attribute indicating if the element can take input focus (is focusable), if it should participate to sequential keyboard navigation. As all input types except for input of type hidden are focusable, this attribute should not be used on form controls, because doing so would require the management of the focus order for all elements within the document with the risk of harming usability and accessibility if done incorrectly. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all input types, containing a text representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to. Such information can typically, but not necessarily, be presented to the user as a tooltip. The title should NOT be used as the primary explanation of the purpose of the form control. Instead, use the <label> element with a for attribute set to the form control\'s id attribute. See Labels below. A string specifying the type of control to render. For example, to create a checkbox, a value of checkbox is used. If omitted (or an unknown value is specified), the input type text is used, creating a plaintext input field. Permitted values are listed in <input> types above. The input control\'s value. When specified in the HTML, this is the initial value, and from then on it can be altered or retrieved at any time using JavaScript to access the respective HTMLInputElement object\'s value property. The value attribute is always optional, though should be considered mandatory for checkbox, radio, and hidden.

Per the specifications, the list attribute is not supported by the hidden, password, checkbox, radio, file, or any of the button types. Depending on the browser, the user may see a custom color palette suggested, tic marks along a range, or even a input that opens like a <select> but allows for non-listed values. Check out the browser compatibility table for the other input types. See the <datalist> element. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the greatest value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element exceeds this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the max attribute isn\'t a number, then the element has no maximum value. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the maximum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the field. This must be an integer value 0 or higher. If no maxlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the field has no maximum length. This value must also be greater than or equal to the value of minlength. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is greater than maxlength UTF-16 code units long. By default, browsers prevent users from entering more characters than allowed by the maxlength attribute. See Client-side validation for more information. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the most negative value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element is less than this this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the min attribute isn\'t a number, then the element has no minimum value. This value must be less than or equal to the value of the max attribute. If the min attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no min value is applied. If the min attribute is valid and a non-empty value is less than the minimum allowed by the min attribute, constraint validation will prevent form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the minimum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the entry field. This must be an non-negative integer value smaller than or equal to the value specified by maxlength. If no minlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the input has no minimum length. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is fewer than minlength UTF-16 code units long, preventing form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. The Boolean multiple attribute, if set, means the user can enter comma separated email addresses in the email widget or can choose more than one file with the file input. See the email and file input type. A string specifying a name for the input control. This name is submitted along with the control\'s value when the form data is submitted. What\'s in a name Consider the name a required attribute (even though it\'s not). If an input has no name specified, or name is empty, the input\'s value is not submitted with the form! (Disabled controls, unchecked radio buttons, unchecked checkboxes, and reset buttons are also not sent.) There are two special cases: _charset_ : If used as the name of an <input> element of type hidden, the input\'s value is automatically set by the user agent to the character encoding being used to submit the form. isindex: For historical reasons, the name isindex is not allowed. name and radio buttons The name attribute creates a unique behavior for radio buttons. Only one radio button in a same-named group of radio buttons can be checked at a time. Selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any currently-selected radio button in the same group. The value of that one checked radio button is sent along with the name if the form is submitted, When tabbing into a series of same-named group of radio buttons, if one is checked, that one will receive focus. If they aren\'t grouped together in source order, if one of the group is checked, tabbing into the group starts when the first one in the group is encountered, skipping all those that aren\'t checked. In other words, if one is checked, tabbing skips the unchecked radio buttons in the group. If none are checked, the radio button group receives focus when the first button in the same name group is reached. Once one of the radio buttons in a group has focus, using the arrow keys will navigate through all the radio buttons of the same name, even if the radio buttons are not grouped together in the source order. HTMLFormElement.elements When an input element is given a name, that name becomes a property of the owning form element\'s HTMLFormElement.elements property. If you have an input whose name is set to guest and another whose name is hat-size, the following code can be used: let form = document.querySelector(\\"form\\"); let guestName = form.elements.guest; let hatSize = form.elements[\\"hat-size\\"]; When this code has run, guestName will be the HTMLInputElement for the guest field, and hatSize the object for the hat-size field. Warning: Avoid giving form elements a name that corresponds to a built-in property of the form, since you would then override the predefined property or method with this reference to the corresponding input. The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the input\'s value must match in order for the value to pass constraint validation. It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the RegExp type, and as documented in our guide on regular expressions; the \'u\' flag is specified when compiling the regular expression, so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as ASCII. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text. If the pattern attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no regular expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely. If the pattern attribute is valid and a non-empty value does not match the pattern, constraint validation will prevent form submission. Tip: If using the pattern attribute, inform the user about the expected format by including explanatory text nearby. You can also include a title attribute to explain what the requirements are to match the pattern; most browsers will display this title as as a tooltip. The visible explanation is required for accessibility. The tooltip is an enhancement. See Client-side validation for more information. The placeholder attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that demonstrates the expected type of data, rather than an explanatory message. The text must not include carriage returns or line feeds. Note: The placeholder attribute is not as semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause unexpected technical issues with your content. See Labels in <input>: The Input (Form Input) element for more information. A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to edit the value of the input. The readonly attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and password input types. See the HTML attribute: readonly for more information. required is a Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user must specify a value for the input before the owning form can be submitted. The required attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, password, checkbox, radio, and file. See Client-side validation and the HTML attribute: required for more information. Valid for email, password, tel, and text input types only. Specifies how much of the input is shown. Basically creates same result as setting CSS width property with a few specialities. The actual unit of the value depends on the input type. For password and text it\'s number of characters (or em units) and pixels for others. CSS width takes precedence over size attribute. Valid for the image input button only, the src is string specifying the URL of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type. Valid for the numeric input types, including number, date/time input types, and range, the step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to. If not explicitly included, step defaults to 1 for number and range, and 1 unit type (second, week, month, day) for the date/time input types. The value can must be a positive number—integer or float—or the special value any, which means no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max). If any is not explicity set, valid values for the number, date/time input types, and range input types are equal to the basis for stepping - the min value and increments of the step value, up to the max value, if specified. For example, if you have <input type=\\"number\\" min=\\"10\\" step=\\"2\\">, then any even integer, 10 or greater, is valid. If omitted, <input type=\\"number\\">, any integer is valid, but floats (like 4.2) are not valid, because step defaults to 1. For 4.2 to be valid, step would have had to be set to any, 0.1, 0.2, or any the min value would have had to be a number ending in .2, such as <input type=\\"number\\" min=\\"-5.2\\"> Note: When the data entered by the user doesn\'t adhere to the stepping configuration, the value is considered invalid in contraint validation and will match the :invalid pseudoclass. The default stepping value for number inputs is 1, allowing only integers to be entered, unless the stepping base is not an integer. The default stepping value for time is 1 second (with 900 being equal to 15 minutes). See Client-side validation for more information. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, an integer attribute indicating if the element can take input focus (is focusable), if it should participate to sequential keyboard navigation. As all input types except for input of type hidden are focusable, this attribute should not be used on form controls, because doing so would require the management of the focus order for all elements within the document with the risk of harming usability and accessibility if done incorrectly. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all input types, containing a text representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to. Such information can typically, but not necessarily, be presented to the user as a tooltip. The title should NOT be used as the primary explanation of the purpose of the form control. Instead, use the <label> element with a for attribute set to the form control\'s id attribute. See Labels below. A string specifying the type of control to render. For example, to create a checkbox, a value of checkbox is used. If omitted (or an unknown value is specified), the input type text is used, creating a plaintext input field. Permitted values are listed in <input> types above. The input control\'s value. When specified in the HTML, this is the initial value, and from then on it can be altered or retrieved at any time using JavaScript to access the respective HTMLInputElement object\'s value property. The value attribute is always optional, though should be considered mandatory for checkbox, radio, and hidden.

There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the maximum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the field. This must be an integer value 0 or higher. If no maxlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the field has no maximum length. This value must also be greater than or equal to the value of minlength. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is greater than maxlength UTF-16 code units long. By default, browsers prevent users from entering more characters than allowed by the maxlength attribute. See Client-side validation for more information. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the most negative value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element is less than this this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the min attribute isn\'t a number, then the element has no minimum value. This value must be less than or equal to the value of the max attribute. If the min attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no min value is applied. If the min attribute is valid and a non-empty value is less than the minimum allowed by the min attribute, constraint validation will prevent form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the minimum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the entry field. This must be an non-negative integer value smaller than or equal to the value specified by maxlength. If no minlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the input has no minimum length. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is fewer than minlength UTF-16 code units long, preventing form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. The Boolean multiple attribute, if set, means the user can enter comma separated email addresses in the email widget or can choose more than one file with the file input. See the email and file input type. A string specifying a name for the input control. This name is submitted along with the control\'s value when the form data is submitted. What\'s in a name Consider the name a required attribute (even though it\'s not). If an input has no name specified, or name is empty, the input\'s value is not submitted with the form! (Disabled controls, unchecked radio buttons, unchecked checkboxes, and reset buttons are also not sent.) There are two special cases: _charset_ : If used as the name of an <input> element of type hidden, the input\'s value is automatically set by the user agent to the character encoding being used to submit the form. isindex: For historical reasons, the name isindex is not allowed. name and radio buttons The name attribute creates a unique behavior for radio buttons. Only one radio button in a same-named group of radio buttons can be checked at a time. Selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any currently-selected radio button in the same group. The value of that one checked radio button is sent along with the name if the form is submitted, When tabbing into a series of same-named group of radio buttons, if one is checked, that one will receive focus. If they aren\'t grouped together in source order, if one of the group is checked, tabbing into the group starts when the first one in the group is encountered, skipping all those that aren\'t checked. In other words, if one is checked, tabbing skips the unchecked radio buttons in the group. If none are checked, the radio button group receives focus when the first button in the same name group is reached. Once one of the radio buttons in a group has focus, using the arrow keys will navigate through all the radio buttons of the same name, even if the radio buttons are not grouped together in the source order. HTMLFormElement.elements When an input element is given a name, that name becomes a property of the owning form element\'s HTMLFormElement.elements property. If you have an input whose name is set to guest and another whose name is hat-size, the following code can be used: let form = document.querySelector(\\"form\\"); let guestName = form.elements.guest; let hatSize = form.elements[\\"hat-size\\"]; When this code has run, guestName will be the HTMLInputElement for the guest field, and hatSize the object for the hat-size field. Warning: Avoid giving form elements a name that corresponds to a built-in property of the form, since you would then override the predefined property or method with this reference to the corresponding input. The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the input\'s value must match in order for the value to pass constraint validation. It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the RegExp type, and as documented in our guide on regular expressions; the \'u\' flag is specified when compiling the regular expression, so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as ASCII. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text. If the pattern attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no regular expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely. If the pattern attribute is valid and a non-empty value does not match the pattern, constraint validation will prevent form submission. Tip: If using the pattern attribute, inform the user about the expected format by including explanatory text nearby. You can also include a title attribute to explain what the requirements are to match the pattern; most browsers will display this title as as a tooltip. The visible explanation is required for accessibility. The tooltip is an enhancement. See Client-side validation for more information. The placeholder attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that demonstrates the expected type of data, rather than an explanatory message. The text must not include carriage returns or line feeds. Note: The placeholder attribute is not as semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause unexpected technical issues with your content. See Labels in <input>: The Input (Form Input) element for more information. A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to edit the value of the input. The readonly attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and password input types. See the HTML attribute: readonly for more information. required is a Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user must specify a value for the input before the owning form can be submitted. The required attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, password, checkbox, radio, and file. See Client-side validation and the HTML attribute: required for more information. Valid for email, password, tel, and text input types only. Specifies how much of the input is shown. Basically creates same result as setting CSS width property with a few specialities. The actual unit of the value depends on the input type. For password and text it\'s number of characters (or em units) and pixels for others. CSS width takes precedence over size attribute. Valid for the image input button only, the src is string specifying the URL of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type. Valid for the numeric input types, including number, date/time input types, and range, the step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to. If not explicitly included, step defaults to 1 for number and range, and 1 unit type (second, week, month, day) for the date/time input types. The value can must be a positive number—integer or float—or the special value any, which means no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max). If any is not explicity set, valid values for the number, date/time input types, and range input types are equal to the basis for stepping - the min value and increments of the step value, up to the max value, if specified. For example, if you have <input type=\\"number\\" min=\\"10\\" step=\\"2\\">, then any even integer, 10 or greater, is valid. If omitted, <input type=\\"number\\">, any integer is valid, but floats (like 4.2) are not valid, because step defaults to 1. For 4.2 to be valid, step would have had to be set to any, 0.1, 0.2, or any the min value would have had to be a number ending in .2, such as <input type=\\"number\\" min=\\"-5.2\\"> Note: When the data entered by the user doesn\'t adhere to the stepping configuration, the value is considered invalid in contraint validation and will match the :invalid pseudoclass. The default stepping value for number inputs is 1, allowing only integers to be entered, unless the stepping base is not an integer. The default stepping value for time is 1 second (with 900 being equal to 15 minutes). See Client-side validation for more information. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, an integer attribute indicating if the element can take input focus (is focusable), if it should participate to sequential keyboard navigation. As all input types except for input of type hidden are focusable, this attribute should not be used on form controls, because doing so would require the management of the focus order for all elements within the document with the risk of harming usability and accessibility if done incorrectly. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all input types, containing a text representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to. Such information can typically, but not necessarily, be presented to the user as a tooltip. The title should NOT be used as the primary explanation of the purpose of the form control. Instead, use the <label> element with a for attribute set to the form control\'s id attribute. See Labels below. A string specifying the type of control to render. For example, to create a checkbox, a value of checkbox is used. If omitted (or an unknown value is specified), the input type text is used, creating a plaintext input field. Permitted values are listed in <input> types above. The input control\'s value. When specified in the HTML, this is the initial value, and from then on it can be altered or retrieved at any time using JavaScript to access the respective HTMLInputElement object\'s value property. The value attribute is always optional, though should be considered mandatory for checkbox, radio, and hidden.

See the image input type. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, it defines a unique identifier (ID) which must be unique in the whole document. Its purpose is to identify the element when linking. The value is used as the value of the <label>\'s for attribute to link the label with the form control. See <label>.

If they aren\'t grouped together in source order, if one of the group is checked, tabbing into the group starts when the first one in the group is encountered, skipping all those that aren\'t checked. In other words, if one is checked, tabbing skips the unchecked radio buttons in the group. If none are checked, the radio button group receives focus when the first button in the same name group is reached. Once one of the radio buttons in a group has focus, using the arrow keys will navigate through all the radio buttons of the same name, even if the radio buttons are not grouped together in the source order. HTMLFormElement.elements When an input element is given a name, that name becomes a property of the owning form element\'s HTMLFormElement.elements property. If you have an input whose name is set to guest and another whose name is hat-size, the following code can be used: let form = document.querySelector(\\"form\\"); let guestName = form.elements.guest; let hatSize = form.elements[\\"hat-size\\"]; When this code has run, guestName will be the HTMLInputElement for the guest field, and hatSize the object for the hat-size field. Warning: Avoid giving form elements a name that corresponds to a built-in property of the form, since you would then override the predefined property or method with this reference to the corresponding input. The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the input\'s value must match in order for the value to pass constraint validation. It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the RegExp type, and as documented in our guide on regular expressions; the \'u\' flag is specified when compiling the regular expression, so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as ASCII. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text. If the pattern attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no regular expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely. If the pattern attribute is valid and a non-empty value does not match the pattern, constraint validation will prevent form submission. Tip: If using the pattern attribute, inform the user about the expected format by including explanatory text nearby. You can also include a title attribute to explain what the requirements are to match the pattern; most browsers will display this title as as a tooltip. The visible explanation is required for accessibility. The tooltip is an enhancement. See Client-side validation for more information. The placeholder attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that demonstrates the expected type of data, rather than an explanatory message. The text must not include carriage returns or line feeds. Note: The placeholder attribute is not as semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause unexpected technical issues with your content. See Labels in <input>: The Input (Form Input) element for more information. A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to edit the value of the input. The readonly attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and password input types. See the HTML attribute: readonly for more information. required is a Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user must specify a value for the input before the owning form can be submitted. The required attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, password, checkbox, radio, and file. See Client-side validation and the HTML attribute: required for more information. Valid for email, password, tel, and text input types only. Specifies how much of the input is shown. Basically creates same result as setting CSS width property with a few specialities. The actual unit of the value depends on the input type. For password and text it\'s number of characters (or em units) and pixels for others. CSS width takes precedence over size attribute. Valid for the image input button only, the src is string specifying the URL of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type. Valid for the numeric input types, including number, date/time input types, and range, the step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to. If not explicitly included, step defaults to 1 for number and range, and 1 unit type (second, week, month, day) for the date/time input types. The value can must be a positive number—integer or float—or the special value any, which means no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max). If any is not explicity set, valid values for the number, date/time input types, and range input types are equal to the basis for stepping - the min value and increments of the step value, up to the max value, if specified. For example, if you have <input type=\\"number\\" min=\\"10\\" step=\\"2\\">, then any even integer, 10 or greater, is valid. If omitted, <input type=\\"number\\">, any integer is valid, but floats (like 4.2) are not valid, because step defaults to 1. For 4.2 to be valid, step would have had to be set to any, 0.1, 0.2, or any the min value would have had to be a number ending in .2, such as <input type=\\"number\\" min=\\"-5.2\\"> Note: When the data entered by the user doesn\'t adhere to the stepping configuration, the value is considered invalid in contraint validation and will match the :invalid pseudoclass. The default stepping value for number inputs is 1, allowing only integers to be entered, unless the stepping base is not an integer. The default stepping value for time is 1 second (with 900 being equal to 15 minutes). See Client-side validation for more information. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, an integer attribute indicating if the element can take input focus (is focusable), if it should participate to sequential keyboard navigation. As all input types except for input of type hidden are focusable, this attribute should not be used on form controls, because doing so would require the management of the focus order for all elements within the document with the risk of harming usability and accessibility if done incorrectly. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all input types, containing a text representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to. Such information can typically, but not necessarily, be presented to the user as a tooltip. The title should NOT be used as the primary explanation of the purpose of the form control. Instead, use the <label> element with a for attribute set to the form control\'s id attribute. See Labels below. A string specifying the type of control to render. For example, to create a checkbox, a value of checkbox is used. If omitted (or an unknown value is specified), the input type text is used, creating a plaintext input field. Permitted values are listed in <input> types above. The input control\'s value. When specified in the HTML, this is the initial value, and from then on it can be altered or retrieved at any time using JavaScript to access the respective HTMLInputElement object\'s value property.

Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the maximum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the field. This must be an integer value 0 or higher. If no maxlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the field has no maximum length. This value must also be greater than or equal to the value of minlength. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is greater than maxlength UTF-16 code units long. By default, browsers prevent users from entering more characters than allowed by the maxlength attribute. See Client-side validation for more information. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the most negative value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element is less than this this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the min attribute isn\'t a number, then the element has no minimum value. This value must be less than or equal to the value of the max attribute. If the min attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no min value is applied.

Only one radio button in a same-named group of radio buttons can be checked at a time. Selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any currently-selected radio button in the same group. The value of that one checked radio button is sent along with the name if the form is submitted, When tabbing into a series of same-named group of radio buttons, if one is checked, that one will receive focus.

It should be a word or short phrase that demonstrates the expected type of data, rather than an explanatory message. The text must not include carriage returns or line feeds. Note: The placeholder attribute is not as semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause unexpected technical issues with your content. See Labels in <input>: The Input (Form Input) element for more information. A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to edit the value of the input. The readonly attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and password input types. See the HTML attribute: readonly for more information. required is a Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user must specify a value for the input before the owning form can be submitted. The required attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, password, checkbox, radio, and file. See Client-side validation and the HTML attribute: required for more information. Valid for email, password, tel, and text input types only. Specifies how much of the input is shown. Basically creates same result as setting CSS width property with a few specialities. The actual unit of the value depends on the input type. For password and text it\'s number of characters (or em units) and pixels for others. CSS width takes precedence over size attribute. Valid for the image input button only, the src is string specifying the URL of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type. Valid for the numeric input types, including number, date/time input types, and range, the step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to. If not explicitly included, step defaults to 1 for number and range, and 1 unit type (second, week, month, day) for the date/time input types. The value can must be a positive number—integer or float—or the special value any, which means no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max). If any is not explicity set, valid values for the number, date/time input types, and range input types are equal to the basis for stepping - the min value and increments of the step value, up to the max value, if specified. For example, if you have <input type=\\"number\\" min=\\"10\\" step=\\"2\\">, then any even integer, 10 or greater, is valid. If omitted, <input type=\\"number\\">, any integer is valid, but floats (like 4.2) are not valid, because step defaults to 1. For 4.2 to be valid, step would have had to be set to any, 0.1, 0.2, or any the min value would have had to be a number ending in .2, such as <input type=\\"number\\" min=\\"-5.2\\"> Note: When the data entered by the user doesn\'t adhere to the stepping configuration, the value is considered invalid in contraint validation and will match the :invalid pseudoclass. The default stepping value for number inputs is 1, allowing only integers to be entered, unless the stepping base is not an integer. The default stepping value for time is 1 second (with 900 being equal to 15 minutes). See Client-side validation for more information. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, an integer attribute indicating if the element can take input focus (is focusable), if it should participate to sequential keyboard navigation. As all input types except for input of type hidden are focusable, this attribute should not be used on form controls, because doing so would require the management of the focus order for all elements within the document with the risk of harming usability and accessibility if done incorrectly. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all input types, containing a text representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to. Such information can typically, but not necessarily, be presented to the user as a tooltip. The title should NOT be used as the primary explanation of the purpose of the form control. Instead, use the <label> element with a for attribute set to the form control\'s id attribute. See Labels below. A string specifying the type of control to render. For example, to create a checkbox, a value of checkbox is used. If omitted (or an unknown value is specified), the input type text is used, creating a plaintext input field. Permitted values are listed in <input> types above. The input control\'s value. When specified in the HTML, this is the initial value, and from then on it can be altered or retrieved at any time using JavaScript to access the respective HTMLInputElement object\'s value property. The value attribute is always optional, though should be considered mandatory for checkbox, radio, and hidden.

Per the specifications, the list attribute is not supported by the hidden, password, checkbox, radio, file, or any of the button types. Depending on the browser, the user may see a custom color palette suggested, tic marks along a range, or even a input that opens like a <select> but allows for non-listed values. Check out the browser compatibility table for the other input types. See the <datalist> element. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the greatest value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element exceeds this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the max attribute isn\'t a number, then the element has no maximum value. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the maximum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the field. This must be an integer value 0 or higher. If no maxlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the field has no maximum length. This value must also be greater than or equal to the value of minlength. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is greater than maxlength UTF-16 code units long. By default, browsers prevent users from entering more characters than allowed by the maxlength attribute. See Client-side validation for more information. Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and range, it defines the most negative value in the range of permitted values. If the value entered into the element is less than this this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the min attribute isn\'t a number, then the element has no minimum value. This value must be less than or equal to the value of the max attribute. If the min attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no min value is applied. If the min attribute is valid and a non-empty value is less than the minimum allowed by the min attribute, constraint validation will prevent form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the minimum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the entry field. This must be an non-negative integer value smaller than or equal to the value specified by maxlength. If no minlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the input has no minimum length. The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text entered into the field is fewer than minlength UTF-16 code units long, preventing form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. The Boolean multiple attribute, if set, means the user can enter comma separated email addresses in the email widget or can choose more than one file with the file input. See the email and file input type. A string specifying a name for the input control. This name is submitted along with the control\'s value when the form data is submitted. What\'s in a name Consider the name a required attribute (even though it\'s not). If an input has no name specified, or name is empty, the input\'s value is not submitted with the form! (Disabled controls, unchecked radio buttons, unchecked checkboxes, and reset buttons are also not sent.) There are two special cases: _charset_ : If used as the name of an <input> element of type hidden, the input\'s value is automatically set by the user agent to the character encoding being used to submit the form. isindex: For historical reasons, the name isindex is not allowed. name and radio buttons The name attribute creates a unique behavior for radio buttons. Only one radio button in a same-named group of radio buttons can be checked at a time. Selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any currently-selected radio button in the same group. The value of that one checked radio button is sent along with the name if the form is submitted, When tabbing into a series of same-named group of radio buttons, if one is checked, that one will receive focus. If they aren\'t grouped together in source order, if one of the group is checked, tabbing into the group starts when the first one in the group is encountered, skipping all those that aren\'t checked. In other words, if one is checked, tabbing skips the unchecked radio buttons in the group. If none are checked, the radio button group receives focus when the first button in the same name group is reached. Once one of the radio buttons in a group has focus, using the arrow keys will navigate through all the radio buttons of the same name, even if the radio buttons are not grouped together in the source order. HTMLFormElement.elements When an input element is given a name, that name becomes a property of the owning form element\'s HTMLFormElement.elements property. If you have an input whose name is set to guest and another whose name is hat-size, the following code can be used: let form = document.querySelector(\\"form\\"); let guestName = form.elements.guest; let hatSize = form.elements[\\"hat-size\\"]; When this code has run, guestName will be the HTMLInputElement for the guest field, and hatSize the object for the hat-size field. Warning: Avoid giving form elements a name that corresponds to a built-in property of the form, since you would then override the predefined property or method with this reference to the corresponding input. The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the input\'s value must match in order for the value to pass constraint validation. It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the RegExp type, and as documented in our guide on regular expressions; the \'u\' flag is specified when compiling the regular expression, so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as ASCII. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text. If the pattern attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no regular expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely. If the pattern attribute is valid and a non-empty value does not match the pattern, constraint validation will prevent form submission. Tip: If using the pattern attribute, inform the user about the expected format by including explanatory text nearby. You can also include a title attribute to explain what the requirements are to match the pattern; most browsers will display this title as as a tooltip. The visible explanation is required for accessibility. The tooltip is an enhancement. See Client-side validation for more information. The placeholder attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that demonstrates the expected type of data, rather than an explanatory message. The text must not include carriage returns or line feeds.

Only one radio button in a same-named group of radio buttons can be checked at a time. Selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any currently-selected radio button in the same group. The value of that one checked radio button is sent along with the name if the form is submitted, When tabbing into a series of same-named group of radio buttons, if one is checked, that one will receive focus. If they aren\'t grouped together in source order, if one of the group is checked, tabbing into the group starts when the first one in the group is encountered, skipping all those that aren\'t checked. In other words, if one is checked, tabbing skips the unchecked radio buttons in the group. If none are checked, the radio button group receives focus when the first button in the same name group is reached. Once one of the radio buttons in a group has focus, using the arrow keys will navigate through all the radio buttons of the same name, even if the radio buttons are not grouped together in the source order. HTMLFormElement.elements When an input element is given a name, that name becomes a property of the owning form element\'s HTMLFormElement.elements property. If you have an input whose name is set to guest and another whose name is hat-size, the following code can be used: let form = document.querySelector(\\"form\\"); let guestName = form.elements.guest; let hatSize = form.elements[\\"hat-size\\"]; When this code has run, guestName will be the HTMLInputElement for the guest field, and hatSize the object for the hat-size field. Warning: Avoid giving form elements a name that corresponds to a built-in property of the form, since you would then override the predefined property or method with this reference to the corresponding input. The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the input\'s value must match in order for the value to pass constraint validation. It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the RegExp type, and as documented in our guide on regular expressions; the \'u\' flag is specified when compiling the regular expression, so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as ASCII. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text. If the pattern attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no regular expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely. If the pattern attribute is valid and a non-empty value does not match the pattern, constraint validation will prevent form submission. Tip: If using the pattern attribute, inform the user about the expected format by including explanatory text nearby. You can also include a title attribute to explain what the requirements are to match the pattern; most browsers will display this title as as a tooltip. The visible explanation is required for accessibility. The tooltip is an enhancement. See Client-side validation for more information. The placeholder attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that demonstrates the expected type of data, rather than an explanatory message. The text must not include carriage returns or line feeds. Note: The placeholder attribute is not as semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause unexpected technical issues with your content. See Labels in <input>: The Input (Form Input) element for more information. A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to edit the value of the input. The readonly attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and password input types. See the HTML attribute: readonly for more information. required is a Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user must specify a value for the input before the owning form can be submitted. The required attribute is supported text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, password, checkbox, radio, and file. See Client-side validation and the HTML attribute: required for more information. Valid for email, password, tel, and text input types only. Specifies how much of the input is shown. Basically creates same result as setting CSS width property with a few specialities. The actual unit of the value depends on the input type. For password and text it\'s number of characters (or em units) and pixels for others. CSS width takes precedence over size attribute. Valid for the image input button only, the src is string specifying the URL of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type. Valid for the numeric input types, including number, date/time input types, and range, the step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to. If not explicitly included, step defaults to 1 for number and range, and 1 unit type (second, week, month, day) for the date/time input types. The value can must be a positive number—integer or float—or the special value any, which means no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max). If any is not explicity set, valid values for the number, date/time input types, and range input types are equal to the basis for stepping - the min value and increments of the step value, up to the max value, if specified. For example, if you have <input type=\\"number\\" min=\\"10\\" step=\\"2\\">, then any even integer, 10 or greater, is valid. If omitted, <input type=\\"number\\">, any integer is valid, but floats (like 4.2) are not valid, because step defaults to 1. For 4.2 to be valid, step would have had to be set to any, 0.1, 0.2, or any the min value would have had to be a number ending in .2, such as <input type=\\"number\\" min=\\"-5.2\\"> Note: When the data entered by the user doesn\'t adhere to the stepping configuration, the value is considered invalid in contraint validation and will match the :invalid pseudoclass. The default stepping value for number inputs is 1, allowing only integers to be entered, unless the stepping base is not an integer. The default stepping value for time is 1 second (with 900 being equal to 15 minutes). See Client-side validation for more information. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, an integer attribute indicating if the element can take input focus (is focusable), if it should participate to sequential keyboard navigation. As all input types except for input of type hidden are focusable, this attribute should not be used on form controls, because doing so would require the management of the focus order for all elements within the document with the risk of harming usability and accessibility if done incorrectly. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all input types, containing a text representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to. Such information can typically, but not necessarily, be presented to the user as a tooltip. The title should NOT be used as the primary explanation of the purpose of the form control. Instead, use the <label> element with a for attribute set to the form control\'s id attribute. See Labels below. A string specifying the type of control to render. For example, to create a checkbox, a value of checkbox is used. If omitted (or an unknown value is specified), the input type text is used, creating a plaintext input field. Permitted values are listed in <input> types above. The input control\'s value. When specified in the HTML, this is the initial value, and from then on it can be altered or retrieved at any time using JavaScript to access the respective HTMLInputElement object\'s value property.

This value must be less than or equal to the value of the max attribute. If the min attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no min value is applied. If the min attribute is valid and a non-empty value is less than the minimum allowed by the min attribute, constraint validation will prevent form submission. See Client-side validation for more information. There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example, this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM. Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines the minimum number of characters (as UTF-16 code units) the user can enter into the entry field.

Valid for the image input button only, the src is string specifying the URL of the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See the image input type. Valid for the numeric input types, including number, date/time input types, and range, the step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to. If not explicitly included, step defaults to 1 for number and range, and 1 unit type (second, week, month, day) for the date/time input types. The value can must be a positive number—integer or float—or the special value any, which means no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max). If any is not explicity set, valid values for the number, date/time input types, and range input types are equal to the basis for stepping - the min value and increments of the step value, up to the max value, if specified. For example, if you have <input type=\\"number\\" min=\\"10\\" step=\\"2\\">, then any even integer, 10 or greater, is valid. If omitted, <input type=\\"number\\">, any integer is valid, but floats (like 4.2) are not valid, because step defaults to 1. For 4.2 to be valid, step would have had to be set to any, 0.1, 0.2, or any the min value would have had to be a number ending in .2, such as <input type=\\"number\\" min=\\"-5.2\\"> Note: When the data entered by the user doesn\'t adhere to the stepping configuration, the value is considered invalid in contraint validation and will match the :invalid pseudoclass. The default stepping value for number inputs is 1, allowing only integers to be entered, unless the stepping base is not an integer. The default stepping value for time is 1 second (with 900 being equal to 15 minutes). See Client-side validation for more information. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input types, an integer attribute indicating if the element can take input focus (is focusable), if it should participate to sequential keyboard navigation. As all input types except for input of type hidden are focusable, this attribute should not be used on form controls, because doing so would require the management of the focus order for all elements within the document with the risk of harming usability and accessibility if done incorrectly. Global attribute valid for all elements, including all input types, containing a text representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to. Such information can typically, but not necessarily, be presented to the user as a tooltip. The title should NOT be used as the primary explanation of the purpose of the form control. Instead, use the <label> element with a for attribute set to the form control\'s id attribute. See Labels below. A string specifying the type of control to render. For example, to create a checkbox, a value of checkbox is used. If omitted (or an unknown value is specified), the input type text is used, creating a plaintext input field. Permitted values are listed in <input> types above. The input control\'s value. When specified in the HTML, this is the initial value, and from then on it can be altered or retrieved at any time using JavaScript to access the respective HTMLInputElement object\'s value property.

This name is submitted along with the control\'s value when the form data is submitted. What\'s in a name Consider the name a required attribute (even though it\'s not). If an input has no name specified, or name is empty, the input\'s value is not submitted with the form! (Disabled controls, unchecked radio buttons, unchecked checkboxes, and reset buttons are also not sent.) There are two special cases: _charset_ : If used as the name of an <input> element of type hidden, the input\'s value is automatically set by the user agent to the character encoding being used to submit the form. isindex: For historical reasons, the name isindex is not allowed. name and radio buttons The name attribute creates a unique behavior for radio buttons. Only one radio button in a same-named group of radio buttons can be checked at a time. Selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any currently-selected radio button in the same group. The value of that one checked radio button is sent along with the name if the form is submitted, When tabbing into a series of same-named group of radio buttons, if one is checked, that one will receive focus. If they aren\'t grouped together in source order, if one of the group is checked, tabbing into the group starts when the first one in the group is encountered, skipping all those that aren\'t checked. In other words, if one is checked, tabbing skips the unchecked radio buttons in the group. If none are checked, the radio button group receives focus when the first button in the same name group is reached. Once one of the radio buttons in a group has focus, using the arrow keys will navigate through all the radio buttons of the same name, even if the radio buttons are not grouped together in the source order. HTMLFormElement.elements When an input element is given a name, that name becomes a property of the owning form element\'s HTMLFormElement.elements property. If you have an input whose name is set to guest and another whose name is hat-size, the following code can be used: let form = document.querySelector(\\"form\\"); let guestName = form.elements.guest; let hatSize = form.elements[\\"hat-size\\"]; When this code has run, guestName will be the HTMLInputElement for the guest field, and hatSize the object for the hat-size field. Warning: Avoid giving form elements a name that corresponds to a built-in property of the form, since you would then override the predefined property or method with this reference to the corresponding input. The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the input\'s value must match in order for the value to pass constraint validation. It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the RegExp type, and as documented in our guide on regular expressions; the \'u\' flag is specified when compiling the regular expression, so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as ASCII. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text. If the pattern attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no regular expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely. If the pattern attribute is valid and a non-empty value does not match the pattern, constraint validation will prevent form submission. Tip: If using the pattern attribute, inform the user about the expected format by including explanatory text nearby. You can also include a title attribute to explain what the requirements are to match the pattern; most browsers will display this title as as a tooltip. The visible explanation is required for accessibility. The tooltip is an enhancement. See Client-side validation for more information. The placeholder attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that demonstrates the expected type of data, rather than an explanatory message. The text must not include carriage returns or line feeds.

If the server does not give credentials to the origin site (through Access-Control-Allow-Credentials HTTP header), the resource will be tainted and its usage restricted. If the attribute is not present, the resource is fetched without a CORS request (i.e. without sending the Origin HTTP header), preventing its non-tainted usage. If invalid, it is handled as if the enumerated keyword anonymous was used. See CORS settings attributes for additional information.

If disabled is specified in the HTML when it is loaded, the stylesheet will not be loaded during page load.

Use this attribute only if the href attribute is present.Indicates the relative importance of the resource. Priority hints are delegated using the values: auto: Indicates no preference. The browser may use its own heuristics to decide the priority of the resource. high: Indicates to the browser that the resource is of high priority. low: Indicates to the browser that the resource is of low priority. Note: The importance attribute may only be used for the <link> element if rel=\\"preload\\" or rel=\\"prefetch\\" is present. Contains inline metadata — a base64-encoded cryptographic hash of the resource (file) you’re telling the browser to fetch. The browser can use this to verify that the fetched resource has been delivered free of unexpected manipulation. See Subresource Integrity.This attribute specifies the media that the linked resource applies to. Its value must be a media type / media query. This attribute is mainly useful when linking to external stylesheets — it allows the user agent to pick the best adapted one for the device it runs on. Notes: In HTML 4, this can only be a simple white-space-separated list of media description literals, i.e., media types and groups, where defined and allowed as values for this attribute, such as print, screen, aural, braille. HTML5 extended this to any kind of media queries, which are a superset of the allowed values of HTML 4. Browsers not supporting CSS3 Media Queries won\'t necessarily recognize the adequate link; do not forget to set fallback links, the restricted set of media queries defined in HTML 4. A string indicating which referrer to use when fetching the resource: no-referrer means that the Referer header will not be sent. no-referrer-when-downgrade means that no Referer header will be sent when navigating to an origin without TLS (HTTPS). This is a user agent’s default behavior, if no policy is otherwise specified. origin means that the referrer will be the origin of the page, which is roughly the scheme, the host, and the port. origin-when-cross-origin means that navigating to other origins will be limited to the scheme, the host, and the port, while navigating on the same origin will include the referrer\'s path. unsafe-url means that the referrer will include the origin and the path (but not the fragment, password, or username). This case is unsafe because it can leak origins and paths from TLS-protected resources to insecure origins. This attribute names a relationship of the linked document to the current document. The attribute must be a space-separated list of link type values.This attribute defines the sizes of the icons for visual media contained in the resource. It must be present only if the rel contains a value of icon or a non-standard type such as Apple\'s apple-touch-icon. It may have the following values: any, meaning that the icon can be scaled to any size as it is in a vector format, like image/svg+xml. a white-space separated list of sizes, each in the format <width in pixels>x<height in pixels> or <width in pixels>X<height in pixels>. Each of these sizes must be contained in the resource. Note: Most icon formats are only able to store one single icon; therefore most of the time the sizes attribute contains only one entry. MS\'s ICO format does, as well as Apple\'s ICNS. ICO is more ubiquitous, so you should use this format if cross-browser support is a concern (especially for old IE versions). The title attribute has special semantics on the <link> element. When used on a <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\"> it defines a preferred or an alternate stylesheet.

The attribute thus defines the reverse relationship compared to the value of the rel attribute. Link type values for the attribute are similar to the possible values for rel. Note: This attribute is considered obsolete by the WHATWG HTML living standard (which is the specification MDN treats as canonical). However, it\'s worth noting that rev is not considered obsolete in the W3C specification. That said, given the uncertainty, relying on rev is unwise. Instead, you should use the rel attribute with the opposite link type value. For example, to establish the reverse link for made, specify author.

If the server does not give credentials to the origin site (by not setting the Access-Control-Allow-Origin HTTP header) the resource will be tainted and its usage restricted. use-credentials A cross-origin request (i.e. with an Origin HTTP header) is performed along with a credential sent (i.e. a cookie, certificate, and/or HTTP Basic authentication is performed). If the server does not give credentials to the origin site (through Access-Control-Allow-Credentials HTTP header), the resource will be tainted and its usage restricted. If the attribute is not present, the resource is fetched without a CORS request (i.e. without sending the Origin HTTP header), preventing its non-tainted usage.
